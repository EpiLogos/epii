      "return": "Quaternary Logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos system, is a six-position (mod 6, 0-5) cyclical systemâ€”not a four-valued system as the name might suggest.  It transcends binary logic via a \"double-covering principle,\" operating simultaneously as a geometric lattice, a dynamic process, and a recursive pattern generator. The six positions represent a complete cycle integrating implicate (hidden/transcendent) and explicate (manifest/immanent) elements: Primordial cause (Position #0), formal causes (Positions #1 and #2), a final cause (Position #4), and Positions 3 and 5, which complete the cycle. Each position contains all others in embryonic form, enabling self-similarity, infinite development, and fractal expansion; the completion of one cycle initiates another.  The system generates numerical patterns primarily based on multiples of 6 (6, 12, 36, 72), but also incorporates 4, 8, and 64 through recursive expansion, resulting in structures with 12, 36, and 72 elements (relevant to systems like the zodiac).  Key principles include quaternionic rotation and the integration of ascending and descending pathways.  Its three-dimensional quaternary nesting produces a 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion, underpinned by mathematical and geometric principles based on groups of four, including double covering, recursive nesting, and parallel tracks. As a non-Boolean system, it integrates structure and process, being and becoming, part and whole, surpassing binary true/false logic by incorporating multiple states.  It includes implicit themes, latent potential, and manifest operations.  The 4-fold explicit structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within this system, focusing on positions 1-4.  This structure is a direct result of applying the principles of Quaternary Logic.  The quaternary structure incorporates principles of vortex mathematics.  Quaternary logic likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.\n\n\nThe Epi-Logos System utilizes Quaternary Logic as its foundational framework.  Its framework incorporates the 4-8-64 expansion and is described as having a 64-bit structure.  The system transcends binary thinking, maintaining mathematical precision while simultaneously functioning as a geometric lattice, a dynamic process, and a recursive pattern generator operating across multiple scales and domains.  It incorporates both implicate and explicate dimensions, exhibiting self-oscillatory dynamics and fractal expansion.\n\n\nReferences\n\n* [KG] api_ingest  (Multiple entities and relationships referencing Quaternary Logic and related concepts)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity: Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity: 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity: Epi-Logos System)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Relationship between Quaternary Logic and Vortex mathematics)\n\n",
