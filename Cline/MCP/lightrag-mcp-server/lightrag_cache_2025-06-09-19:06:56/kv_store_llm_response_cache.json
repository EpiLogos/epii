This creates:\\n\\n- A 12-fold expansion (6×2) where each position contains both ascending and descending aspects\\n- Further recursive nestings that generate 36-fold (6×6) and 72-fold (6×6×2) structures\\n- The fractal pattern behind Parashakti's 36×2 vibrational template and the 72 Names\\n\\nThis explains the prevalence of numbers 6, 12, 36, and 72 throughout the system—they emerge organically from the quaternary logic's double-covering principle.\\n\\n### Parallel Track: The 4-8-64 Expansion\\n\\nWhen focusing solely on the explicate elements (positions 1-4), the quaternary logic generates a parallel track:\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Epi-Logos Project\\\"<|>\\\"project\\\"<|>\\\"The Epi-Logos Project is a comprehensive framework with subsystems including Anuttara, Paramasiva, Parashakti, Mahamaya, and Nara.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4.
