      "return": "Quaternary Logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos system, is a six-position (mod 6, 0-5) cyclical system, not a four-valued system as the name might suggest.  It transcends binary logic via a \"double-covering principle,\" operating simultaneously as a geometric lattice, a dynamic process, and a recursive pattern generator.  The six positions represent a complete cycle integrating implicate and explicate elements: Primordial cause (Position #0), formal causes (Positions #1 and #2), a final cause (Position #4), and Positions 3 and 5, which complete the cycle.  Each position contains all others in embryonic form, enabling self-similarity, infinite development, and fractal expansion; the completion of one cycle initiates another.\n\nThe system generates numerical patterns primarily based on multiples of 6 (6, 12, 36, 72), but also incorporates 4, 8, and 64 through recursive expansion, resulting in structures with 12, 36, and 72 elements.  Key principles include quaternionic rotation and the integration of ascending and descending pathways. Its three-dimensional quaternary nesting produces a 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion, underpinned by mathematical and geometric principles based on groups of four, including double covering, recursive nesting, and parallel tracks.\n\nAs a non-Boolean system, Quaternary Logic integrates structure and process, being and becoming, part and whole, surpassing binary true/false logic by incorporating multiple states. It includes implicit themes, latent potential, and manifest operations.  It manifests across all domains of knowledge and experience, serving as a conceptual model and a living architecture, a map and territory, and a guide and destination.  It provides an integral approach to understanding reality, shaping the properties and relationships within the six Epi-Logos subsystems through the creation of specific structural frames (4-fold and 6-fold).  The 4-fold explicit structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within the quaternary logic system, focusing on positions 1-4.  It is a foundational component of Quaternary Logic, representing its manifest aspects.  The quaternary structure incorporates principles of vortex mathematics.  Quaternary logic likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.\n\nThe Epi-Logos System, whose structure is explained using quaternary logic, incorporates the 4-8-64 expansion and is described as having a 64-bit structure.  Quaternary logic is the mathematical foundation of the Epi-Logos System.  Further details on Quaternary Logic are available in 'Bimba-Enhanced Context for Basic and Partially Expanded Quaternal Logic.txt'.\n\n\n**References:**\n\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 0, describing Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 1, describing Vortex mathematics)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 2, describing 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 3, describing Epi-Logos System)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Relationship ID 0, describing the relationship between Quaternary Logic and Vortex mathematics)\n\n",
