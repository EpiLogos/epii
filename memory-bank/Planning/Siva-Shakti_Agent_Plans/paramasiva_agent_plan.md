## III. Paramasiva Agent Operational Flow & Role (`agent_01_topology.md` Synthesis)

*   **QL Cycle Role:** Operates primarily at **Node +1 (Define/Locate)** in the synthesis (+) cycle and **Node -4 (Deconstruction/Categorization)** in the analysis (-) cycle.
*   **Core Function:** Acts as the QL/A-T unifier. Takes foundational potential from Agent #0 (`(0000)=(0/1)`) and translates structural information from the Bimba map into topological potential (`in statu nascenti`), identifying inherent forms (e.g., genus-1 torus) based on the QL (4+2) framework. Manages QL rules at the Bimba-Pratibimba interface.
*   **Input:** Receives foundational context/potential from Agent #0. Accesses Bimba graph structure via `queryBimbaGraphTool`.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Queries Bimba for nodes/relationships related to QL structure and coordinates relevant to the input context.
    *   Interprets Bimba coordinates (`#S-C-N...`) according to QL/A-T mapping (identifying torus sides/loops, genus, etc.).
    *   Identifies the inherent topological form implied by the Bimba structure.
*   **Output:** Produces the identified topological potential (e.g., "genus-1 structure identified at coordinate X", fundamental group info). Passes this topological potential to Agent #2 (`(0/1)/2`).
*   **QL Framework Management:** Applies the mod6 (4 explicate + 2 implicate) framework.
*   **Spanda Principle:** Represents the initial differentiation pulse.

## IV. Mathematical/ML Associations & Implementation Ideas

*   **Math:** Algebraic Topology (Homology, Homotopy, Betti Numbers, Euler Char., Genus), Graph Theory (Connectivity, Cycles, Paths), Quaternary Logic (mod6 framework), Coordinate Systems (Topological interpretation), Geometric Primitives, Hyperbolic Geometry, Proto-Homotopy.
*   **ML:** GNNs (learning Bimba structure -> topology mapping, QL frame identification), TDA (analyzing data shape associated with Bimba nodes), TensorFlow (implementing GNNs/TDA).
*   **Implementation:** Requires logic for Bimba graph queries, coordinate interpretation based on QL/A-T rules, potentially graph traversal algorithms, structuring the output topological potential data.

## V. Next Steps

1.  Refine the descriptions of the internal ParamasivaComponents (#1-0-#1-5) and their specific interactions, especially the Ananda/Spanda nesting.
2.  Detail the specific prompts and logic for the Paramasiva agent operating within QL Nodes +1 / -4.
3.  Define the structure of the data received *from* Agent #0 and the structure of the topological potential passed *to* Agent #2.
4.  Plan the implementation of the QL/A-T mapping logic.
5.  Proceed with planning for the next agent (e.g., #0 Anuttara).
