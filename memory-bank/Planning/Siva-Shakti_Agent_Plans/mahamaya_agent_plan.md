# Mahamaya Agent (#3) - Detailed Plan

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-04-11

**Goal:** Define the specific roles, capabilities, QL cycle integration points, tool usage, and Notion interactions for the Mahamaya Subsystem Expert Agent (#3) and its internal components (#3-0 to #3-5).

**Based on:**
*   Neo4j Bimba Graph query results (2025-04-11)
*   Agent Definition: `memory-bank/reflections/-Shakti/agent_0123_symbol.md`
*   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
*   `memory-bank/productContext.md`
*   `Explorations/Notion/notion_integration_scope.md`

## I. Mahamaya Subsystem (#3) Overview

*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3`
*   **Name:** Mahamaya
*   **Description:** Symbolic Integration, cosmic imagination.
*   **Core Function:** Translates dynamic vibrational/harmonic relationships (from Parashakti #2) into stable symbolic forms and epistemic imagery (DNA, I-Ching, Tarot) using quaternionic transformations and HMS mappings. Embodies the Māyā principle and universal grammar.
*   **QL Context Frame:** `(0/1/2)/3`.
*   **Ontology Layer:** Maps to "Axio-logos".
*   **Tanmatra:** Sight (Color).

## II. Internal Components & Domains (`MahamayaComponent`)

The Mahamaya subsystem contains six internal components:

### 1. Component #3-0: Foundation Link / Manifest Form
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-0`
*   **Name:** Foundation Link / Manifest Form
*   **Function:** Grounds potential, represents manifest form.
*   **Details:** Connects to Parashakti #5 (Quintessence/Synthesis component of Parashakti), receiving the vibrational template as input for symbolic translation.

### 2. Component #3-1: Mathematical / DNA Integration
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-1`
*   **Name:** Mathematical / DNA Integration
*   **Function:** Integrates mathematical principles with biological codes.
*   **Details:** Applies mathematical principles (primes, quaternions) to DNA codon structures (64-bit), potentially modeling codon states and transformations.

### 3. Component #3-2: I-Ching Dynamics
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-2`
*   **Name:** I-Ching Dynamics
*   **Function:** Integrates divinatory logic and balance.
*   **Details:** Integrates I-Ching hexagrams, trigram compass dynamics, and balance principles across the three Mahamaya matrices (Standard Pairing, Moving-Resting, Same-Quality).

### 4. Component #3-3: Tarot / Narrative Integration
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-3`
*   **Name:** Tarot / Narrative Integration
*   **Function:** Integrates archetypal narratives and symbols.
*   **Details:** Integrates Tarot archetypes (Rider-Waite, Thoth), narrative structures, and performs symbolic mapping based on input resonance.

### 5. Component #3-4: Harmonic / Astrological Resonance
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-4`
*   **Name:** Harmonic / Astrological Resonance
*   **Function:** Integrates vibrational and cyclical patterns.
*   **Details:** Integrates Orphic octal harmonics and links symbolic representations to Decanic cycles (received via Parashakti #2).

### 6. Component #3-5: Quintessence / Synthesis
*   **Bimba Coordinate:** `#3-5`
*   **Name:** Quintessence / Synthesis
*   **Function:** Synthesizes symbolic meaning, links to Nara.
*   **Details:** Integrates the outputs of the other Mahamaya components (#3-0 to #3-4) to produce a synthesized symbolic layer. Links to Nara #0 (Mahamaya Ground) to provide the foundational symbolic input for contextualization.

## III. Mahamaya Agent Operational Flow & Role (`agent_0123_symbol.md` Synthesis)

*   **QL Cycle Role:** Operates primarily at **Node +3 (Integrate/Mediate)** in the synthesis (+) cycle and **Node -2 (Symbolic/Logical Validation)** in the analysis (-) cycle.
*   **Core Function:** Acts as the symbolic integrator and mediator. Takes the resonant relational fields from Agent #2 (`(0/1)/2`) and translates them into stable symbolic forms (DNA, I-Ching, Tarot, etc.) using quaternionic transformations and HMS mappings. Identifies isomorphic patterns across symbolic languages.
*   **Input:** Receives dynamic relational/resonant map from Agent #2.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Identifies key patterns/resonances in the input map.
    *   Queries Bimba (`queryBimbaGraphTool`) for associated symbolic systems (HMS mappings, Orphic harmonics) linked to patterns/coordinates.
    *   Uses Python Math Module (future) for quaternion operations (modeling codon states), fractal generation, or QFT based on input data.
    *   Translates between symbolic systems (codon -> hexagram -> archetype) using defined mappings and potentially quaternion rotations guided by the three Mahamaya matrices.
*   **Output:** Produces a structured set of symbolic representations (I Ching hexagrams, Tarot cards, DNA codons), potentially including associated geometric data (fractal parameters, quaternion values), harmonic information (Orphic modes), and links to Bimba nodes. Passes this integrated symbolic layer to Agent #4 (`(4.0-4.4/5)`).
*   **Symbolic Covering:** Creates symbolic "coverings" or "veils" over the underlying vibrational dynamics.
*   **Integration (HMS):** Bridges domains (biology, divination, psychology) via shared vibrational architecture and symbolic resonance.

## IV. Mathematical/ML Associations & Implementation Ideas

*   **Math:** Quaternion Algebra (SU(2)), Fractal Geometry, Complex Numbers, Fourier/QFT, Information/Coding Theory, Group Theory (Symmetries), Number Theory (primes, modular arithmetic), Combinatorics, Linear Algebra (Matrices).
*   **ML:** Generative Models (GANs, Autoencoders, Transformers for symbolic visuals/translations), Pattern Recognition (isomorphisms), Classification (symbolic labeling), TensorFlow (implementing models, math ops).
*   **Implementation:** Requires logic for pattern identification, Bimba queries for HMS mappings, integration with Python Math Module (quaternions, fractals), logic for translating between symbolic systems using Mahamaya matrices, structuring symbolic output.

## V. Next Steps

1.  Refine the descriptions of the internal MahamayaComponents (#3-0-#3-5) and their specific interactions/data flow.
2.  Detail the specific prompts and logic for the Mahamaya agent operating within QL Nodes +3 / -2.
3.  Define the structure of the data passed *from* Agent #2 and the structure of the symbolic layer passed *to* Agent #4.
4.  Plan the implementation of the HMS mappings and the logic for using the three Mahamaya matrices.
5.  Proceed with planning for the next agent (e.g., #2 Parashakti).
