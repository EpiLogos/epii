# -Shakti: Expression Modules

This document outlines the conceptual plan for dedicated modules responsible for generating the non-textual, multi-modal expressions leveraged by the Siva-Shakti agents and rendered by the frontend. These modules represent core -Shakti capabilities.

## 1. Python Math/Geometry Module

*   **Purpose:** To handle complex mathematical computations and geometric transformations potentially required by agents `(0/1)`, `(0/1/2)`, and `(0/1/2/3)`.
*   **Potential Capabilities:**
    *   Quaternion algebra (multiplication, interpolation/Slerp).
    *   Advanced Fourier analysis (QFT, potentially wavelets).
    *   Fractal generation (Mandelbrot, Julia sets - complex & quaternion).
    *   Topological analysis (persistent homology, Betti numbers - if feasible libraries exist).
    *   Geometric transformations based on QL/A-T principles.
*   **Architecture:** Likely implemented as a Python microservice accessed via API from the main Node.js backend.
*   **Libraries:** `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `quaternion`, `pywt`, potentially TensorFlow for specific tasks (e.g., fractal generation, autoencoders).
*   **Interaction:** Agents in the QL cycle (Node.js) would formulate requests (e.g., "calculate quaternion rotation for symbol X", "generate fractal based on parameters Y") and send them to this service. The service returns structured data (e.g., coordinates, transformation matrices, frequency spectra).

## 2. Image/Sound Association & Generation Module

*   **Purpose:** To translate the symbolic, mathematical, and resonant information processed by the agents into concrete visual and auditory representations for the frontend. Bridges the abstract processing with sensory experience.
*   **Potential Capabilities:**
    *   Mapping Bimba coordinates or QL states to specific visual symbols or geometric forms (potentially retrieving pre-defined assets or generating simple forms).
    *   Translating frequency/harmonic data (from Agent `(0/1/2)` or the Math Module) into sound parameters (pitch, timbre, duration) for sonification.
    *   Generating cymatic-like visual patterns based on input frequencies or resonant states.
    *   Associating specific archetypes or epistemic modes with visual themes or sound palettes.
*   **Architecture:** Could be part of the Python service, or potentially implemented partially in the Node.js backend or even the frontend (using libraries like p5.js, Tone.js, Three.js) depending on complexity and real-time requirements.
*   **Interaction:** Agent `(4.0-4.4/5)` would likely orchestrate calls to this module, taking the outputs from earlier agents and requesting corresponding visual/auditory elements to accompany the textual dialogue response. The output would be data structures the frontend can interpret and render.
