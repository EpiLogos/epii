# -Shakti: Frontend Capabilities & Potential

This document outlines the desired capabilities and potential of the Epi-Logos frontend interface, representing the -Shakti aspect – the medium or canvas through which the system's integrated knowledge (Siva-Shakti activity, generated by the agents) is expressed and interacted with. These capabilities are derived from the requirements identified during the agent detailing process.

## Core Vision:

The frontend aims to be a **single, integrated, interactive, multi-modal, and layered interface** serving as both a user portal for exploring the "Cosmic Mind" model (facilitated by Agent 4) and an intuitive developer console for tuning the system. It must be capable of rendering the diverse outputs generated by the QL cycle agents (0 through 5).

## Key Capabilities & Potential Features:

1.  **Unified Interface:**
    *   Present a cohesive experience where dialogue (Agent 4), visualizations (Agents 1-3, Expression Modules), contextual information (Agent 4 retrieving from Mongo/Notion), and potentially interactive controls coexist seamlessly. Avoid fragmented views or multiple separate pages for different functions.

2.  **Multi-Modal Rendering Engine:**
    *   **Text Dialogue:** Render conversational text output from Agent 4, potentially including formatted text, code blocks, or lists.
    *   **Geometric/Topological Visualizations:** Render 2D/3D representations of topological forms (tori, Möbius strips), geometric primitives (Flower of Life elements), and potentially graph structures (Bimba snippets, relational fields) based on data provided by Agents 1 & 2. Requires libraries like Three.js, p5.js, or D3.js.
    *   **Symbolic Visualizations:** Render symbolic imagery associated with HMS (I Ching hexagrams, Tarot card representations), potentially fractal patterns (Mandelbrot/Julia sets generated via Expression Module), or other visual metaphors based on data from Agent 3.
    *   **Sonification:** Play audio outputs representing harmonic relationships, musical modes (Decanic), mantras, or resonant frequencies based on data provided by Agent 2 and potentially generated by the Image/Sound Association module. Requires Web Audio API integration or Ableton Live MCP integration.

3.  **Layered Display Mechanism:**
    *   **Concept:** Allow users to perceive the cumulative nature of the QL cycle's output as orchestrated by Agent 4. The interface must display the final synthesized response (all layers active) but also provide controls to toggle the visibility of contributions from specific conceptual layers/agent outputs:
        *   Layer 1: Topological Potential (from Agent `(0/1)`)
        *   Layer 2: Resonance/Relational Fields (from Agent `(0/1)/2`)
        *   Layer 3: Symbolic Covering (from Agent `(0/1/2)/3`)
    *   **Implementation:** Requires the backend (Agent 4) to send structured data clearly identifying the contribution of each layer (0-3). The frontend needs intuitive UI controls (e.g., checkboxes, sliders, layer buttons) to manage the visibility and perhaps opacity/prominence of each layer in the unified display.

4.  **Interactive Exploration & Input:**
    *   **Dialogue Input:** Standard text input for user queries directed to Agent 4.
    *   **Layer Toggling:** Controls to show/hide conceptual layers as described above.
    *   **Visualization Interaction:** Allow interaction with visual elements: rotating 3D models, zooming, panning, potentially clicking on nodes/symbols to get more information (triggering new backend queries via Agent 4).
    *   **Notion Integration:** Display links to relevant Notion pages (provided by Agents 4 or 5) for deeper exploration of crystallized knowledge or archetypes. Potentially embed Notion content directly if feasible (Ideal!).
    *   **Context Input:** Mechanisms for user to provide contextual input (e.g., birthdate for Nara personalization, Natal Charts, detailed journaling and dreams, specific topics of interest, uploading documents for analysis - requires backend support and privacy management).

5.  **Developer Console Features (Integrated or Separate View):**
    *   Monitor QL cycle state progression and agent activity (visualizing which node is active).
    *   Allow adjustment of LLM parameters or prompts for specific agents/nodes for testing/tuning.
    *   Provide controls to trigger specific backend processes (e.g., `syncNotionUpdatesTool` managed by Agent 5).
    *   Visualize backend performance metrics or graph database states (e.g., showing snippets of Bimba graph).
    *   Explore Metasymbol as a symbolic wrapper for the dveeloper concosle view over full sysstem dynamics.
    *   Potentially Non-integrated view (a page per subsystem, showing how each is operating across Siva-, -Shakti and Siva-Shakti layers) - separates developer view from integrated user experience view.

6.  **Resonant Aesthetics & UX:**
    *   UI design, color palettes, typography, animations, and sound design should align with the project's philosophical and harmonic principles (vibrational ontology, sacred geometry).
    *   The user experience should feel integrated, intuitive, fluid, and resonant, reflecting the underlying coherence of the Epi-Logos system. Aim for an experience that facilitates insight and understanding (Pratyabhijna).

*(Detailed UI/UX designs, specific component choices (React, Vue, Svelte?), library selections (Three.js, D3.js, Tone.js?), API requirements for layered multi-modal data structures, and implementation strategies will be developed based on these capabilities.)*
