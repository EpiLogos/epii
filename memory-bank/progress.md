# Progress

## What Works:
*   Basic project structure with separate frontend and backend directories is set up.
*   Core memory bank files (`project_brief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are created and updated to reflect latest architectural decisions (QL Cycle, Custom Memory).
*   Google Gemini agent is set up with frontend and backend, and is responding to chat messages (though lacking context/memory).
*   `.env` file is updated with necessary variables (Neo4j, Qdrant, MongoDB, Notion placeholders) and loading correctly. Hardcoded MongoDB URI removed from config.
*   Backend API endpoint (/api/chat) is functional (though currently calling test logic).
*   High-level conceptual context (QL/A-T relationship, layered ontology) explored and integrated into core memory bank files.
*   Initial Neo4j 'bimba' seed map created and populated with subsystem structures (scripts v0.1-v0.16).
*   **Pivoted Memory Architecture:** Adopted custom Bimba-Pratibimba model (Neo4j, Qdrant, MongoDB, Notion), replacing Mem0.
*   **Adopted QL 0-5 Cycle:** Defined core backend processing logic around the 6-stage QL synthesis cycle.
*   Created new core implementation plan: `ql_cycle_memory_v2_plan.md`. Sidelined previous Nara/Mem0 plans.
*   **Phase 1 Foundations Implemented:**
    *   Service files created for Neo4j, Qdrant, MongoDB, Notion clients.
    *   Google Embeddings service (`embedText` function) implemented.
    *   Mongoose schemas created for `Users`, `Conversations`, `UserMemory`.
    *   Core LangChain tools implemented: `queryBimbaGraphTool`, `searchPratibimbaContextTool`, `getConversationHistoryTool`, `getUserContextTool`, `manageMemoryTool`, `proposeNotionUpdateTool`, `syncNotionUpdatesTool`.
*   **Connections Verified:** Successfully verified connections to Neo4j, Qdrant, MongoDB, and Notion via `verify_connections.mjs`.
*   **Qdrant Collection:** Confirmed `pratibimba_store` collection exists.
*   **LangGraph & Ingestion Structure:** Core logic for QL Cycle graph (`ql_cycle.graph.mjs`) nodes (+0 to +5) and Data Ingestion Pipeline (`ingestion.pipeline.mjs`) implemented and refined through testing.
*   **Bimba Coordinate System & Mapping:** Successfully developed and applied hierarchical coordinate system (`bimbaCoordinate`) to key structural nodes. Populated detailed content for Epii lenses. Generated coordinate map (`bimba_coordinate_map.md`) and added root coordinate (`#`) to Project node.
*   **Phase 2.5 Testing:** Successfully executed basic tests for the ingestion pipeline and QL cycle graph, validating core mechanics, data flow, and tool integrations after resolving environment, state passing, and data storage bugs. Corrected Bimba graph relationships (`:SUCCEEDED_BY_AND_MANIFESTS_THROUGH`, `:COMPLETES_CYCLE_INTO`).
*   **Horizon 2.0 Planning:** Completed detailed planning for -Shakti / Siva-Shakti Integration, including agent definitions, frontend capabilities, and roadmap (`Horizon_2.0_shakti_integration_plan.md`).
*   **Unified Research Tool:** Implemented `researchAndIntegrate` tool in Bimba-Pratibimba-Memory-MCP server, combining fetch, Notion storage, and RAG ingestion. Removed `fetchWebResearch`. Updated `searchWeb` to return JSON.
*   **Agent Structural Planning (Phase -1):** Completed initial structural mapping for all six Subsystem Expert Agents (#0-#5), including nested components (Spanda, MEF, Jungian Arena, etc.) and Bimba coordinates, documented in `memory-bank/reflections/Siva-Shakti_Agent_Plans/`. Clarified Siva-/-Shakti agent model distinctions in relevant documentation.
*   **Defined First Integration Plan:** Created `horizon_2.0_first_integration_crystallization_pathway.md` to focus initial efforts.
*   **Refined Notion Interaction Logic:** Updated `Horizon_2.0_shakti_integration_plan.md` with a summary of the Bimba-centric approach for Notion interaction.
*   **Implemented Backend Crystallization Pathway (Steps 1-3):**
    *   Added `resolveBimbaCoordinate`, `appendNotionBlock`, `crystallizeToNotion` tools to `Bimba-Pratibimba-Memory-MCP`.
    *   Updated QL Cycle Node +5 (`ql_cycle.graph.mjs`) to bind tools and include prompt instructions.
*   **Refined Frontend Notion Embedding Plan:** Updated `horizon_2.0_first_integration_crystallization_pathway.md` with details for textual and image embedding placeholders. (Implementation deferred).
*   **Debugged QL Cycle Tool Binding:** Successfully resolved Gemini API 400 errors related to tool schema formatting by simplifying Zod schemas and standardizing tool definitions in `ql_cycle.graph.mjs`, `vector.tools.mjs`, `mongo.tools.mjs`. Temporarily disabled Notion tools.
*   **Basic Chat Functionality Operational:** Frontend (`Chat.tsx`) successfully communicates with the backend (`/api/chat`), which invokes the QL Cycle graph (`ql_cycle.graph.mjs`) and returns a text response from Node 5.
*   **Backend Refactoring (Bimba-Alignment):**
    *   Created `subsystems/` directory structure (#0-#5).
    *   Moved QL Node logic to `graph/nodes/`.
    *   Updated `ql_cycle.graph.mjs` to import node logic.
    *   Created placeholder Expert Agent files in `subsystems/`.
    *   Refactored `chat.controller.mjs` for mode dispatching (stubbed).
*   **Notion Tool Binding Fix Attempted:**
    *   Updated Zod schema for `appendNotionBlock` in B-P MCP server (`index.ts`).
    *   Re-enabled Notion tools (`resolveBimbaCoordinate`, `appendNotionBlock`) in QL Node +5 (`node_5_respond_update.mjs`). **Status: Untested.**
*   **Plans Updated:**
    *   `Horizon_2.0_shakti_integration_plan.md` updated to v2.0 (Bimba-aligned, QL-ordered, modes).
    *   `horizon_2.0_first_integration_crystallization_pathway.md` updated to v1.1 (focused MVP Step 1).
*   **Strategic Shift:** Decided to implement distinct Nara (query) and Epii (document analysis) pipelines based on QL principles. Updated `bimba_tech_architecture.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.
*   **Frontend Epii Page:** Created `/epii` route and `EpiiChatPage.tsx` component, sending `mode: 'epii'`. Added link to Navbar.
*   **Backend Startup Fix:** Corrected import error in `chat.routes.mjs`.

## What's Left to Build (Revised Strategy):

**Epii Mode Pipeline (Current Focus):**
1.  **Design Epii Analysis Pipeline:** Define stages (Fetch Notion Doc -> Analyze Structure/Content -> Synthesize Payload), data flow, and `notionUpdatePayload` structure. *(Next Step)*
2.  **Implement Notion Content Fetching:** Create backend function/tool (B-P MCP or service).
3.  **Implement Core Epii Analysis Logic:** Develop document processing (chunking, tagging, mapping extraction, variation identification).
4.  **Implement Epii Payload Synthesis:** Format analysis results into `notionUpdatePayload`.
5.  **Adapt `/epii` Frontend:** Trigger new pipeline, display payload (JSON initially).
6.  **(Later) Build Frontend Canvas:** UI for reviewing/editing the payload.
7.  **(Later) Implement Crystallization API & Tool:** `/api/crystallize` endpoint calling `crystallizeToNotion`.

**Nara Mode Pipeline (Refinements - Lower Priority):**
*   Fix Node +5 TypeError (`msg._getType is not a function`).
*   Fix Node +2 Qdrant ToolInputParsingException.
*   Improve Node +0 Keyword Extraction.
*   Implement simpler RAG path if needed.
*   Implement Nara Expert Agent logic.

**Cross-Cutting / Future:**
*   Implement Notion-Triggered Ingestion (aligned with Epii pipeline needs).
*   Implement Notion Sync Tool (`syncNotionUpdatesTool`).
*   Implement (-) QL Cycle logic for both pipelines.
*   Implement remaining Expert Agents (#0-#3).
*   Develop advanced frontend visualizations & expression modules.
*   Address LightRAG MCP errors.
*   User Auth, etc.

## Current Status:
**Milestone:** Strategic shift defined towards separate Nara (query) and Epii (document analysis) pipelines. Core documentation updated (`bimba_tech_architecture.md`, `systemPatterns.md`). Frontend `/epii` page created. Servers restarted successfully after fixing backend import error. Initial test revealed need for distinct pipelines.
**Current Focus:** Designing the Epii Document Analysis Pipeline and the structure of its output payload (`notionUpdatePayload`).

## Known Issues / Areas for Refinement:
*   **Epii Pipeline:** Needs full design and implementation.
*   **Nara Pipeline (Existing QL Cycle):**
    *   Node +5 TypeError (`msg._getType is not a function`).
    *   Node +2 Qdrant ToolInputParsingException.
    *   Node +0 Keyword Extraction is rudimentary.
    *   Notion Tool Binding (Deferred / Likely not needed for Nara).
*   **Notion Embedding:** Blocked by CSP. Link-based display planned as initial solution.
*   **LightRAG MCP Errors:** Persistent Neo4j timeouts and LLM compatibility errors require investigation.
*   **(-) QL Cycle / Analysis Logic:** Not implemented for either pipeline.
*   **Expert Agent Logic:** Placeholders exist, core logic TBD.
*   **Data Seeding:** Requires refined ingestion pipeline (especially tagging for Epii analysis).
*   **Developer Console:** Not implemented.
