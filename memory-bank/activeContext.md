# Active Context (Updated 2025-04-14)

## Current Work Focus (Based on H2.0 v2.0 Plan):

**Phase 1: Foundation & Epii Core Loop (#5 Focus)**
*(See `Implementation Markdown Files - Ad Hoc/Active/Horizon_2.0_shakti_integration_plan.md` v2.0 for full details)*

*   **Backend Refactoring (Bimba-Alignment): COMPLETE**
    *   Created `subsystems/` directory structure (#0-#5).
    *   Moved QL Node logic to `graph/nodes/`.
    *   Updated `ql_cycle.graph.mjs` to import node logic.
    *   Created placeholder Expert Agent files in `subsystems/`.
    *   Refactored `chat.controller.mjs` for mode dispatching (stubbed).
*   **Notion Tool Binding Fix Attempted: COMPLETE (Code Updated)**
    *   Updated Zod schema for `appendNotionBlock` in B-P MCP server (`index.ts`).
    *   Re-enabled Notion tools (`resolveBimbaCoordinate`, `appendNotionBlock`) in QL Node +5 (`node_5_respond_update.mjs`).
    *   **Status: Requires testing.**
*   **Plans Updated: COMPLETE**
    *   `Horizon_2.0_shakti_integration_plan.md` updated to v2.0 (Bimba-aligned, QL-ordered, modes).
    *   `horizon_2.0_first_integration_crystallization_pathway.md` updated to v1.1 (focused MVP Step 1).

## Supporting Files Status:
*   **`notion_id_map.json`:** Provides the essential mapping from `bimbaCoordinate` to `notionPageId`. Currently generated by `build_notion_index.mjs`. Will be maintained by Notion creation/sync tools going forward. Needs verification/update after initial seeding.
*   **`notion_content_nodes_index.json`:** Contains a snapshot of Notion page properties and block structures, indexed by `notionPageId`. Also generated by `build_notion_index.mjs`. Utility TBD.

## Completed Work (Summary - See progress.md for full history):
*   Basic project structure setup (Frontend/Backend).
*   Core Memory Bank files established.
*   Gemini LLM integration functional for basic chat.
*   `.env` setup complete.
*   Bimba-Pratibimba memory architecture adopted (Neo4j, Qdrant, MongoDB, Notion).
*   QL Cycle (+) phase structure implemented (LangGraph).
*   Core B-P MCP tools implemented.
*   DB/API connections verified.
*   Bimba graph seeded with core structure & coordinates.
*   Ingestion pipeline basics implemented.
*   LightRAG MCP integrated for fused RAG.
*   Agent structural planning completed (`Siva-Shakti_Agent_Plans/`).
*   Backend refactored for Bimba-alignment (structure, node separation, controller dispatch).
*   Notion tool binding fix *attempted*.
*   Development plans updated (H2.0 v2.0, Crystallization v1.1).

## Next Steps (Based on H2.0 v2.0 Plan - Phase 1):

1.  **Test Refactoring & Notion Tool Binding Fix:**
    *   User to recompile/restart B-P MCP and backend servers.
    *   Perform smoke tests (Nara/Epii modes via API/frontend).
    *   Specifically test Epii mode crystallization to verify Notion tool binding fix.
2.  **Implement Notion-Triggered Ingestion:** (Phase 1, Step 3)
    *   Create trigger mechanism (endpoint/tool).
    *   Adapt ingestion pipeline to use Notion source & Bimba coordinate tagging.
3.  **Implement Notion Sync Tool:** (Phase 1, Step 4)
    *   Develop `syncNotionUpdatesTool` in B-P MCP.
4.  **Implement Basic Epii Mode Logic:** (Phase 1, Step 5)
    *   Develop Epii Expert Agent logic for Node +5 (payload prep) & Node -0 (sync trigger).
    *   Implement basic (-) QL nodes (-0, -5).
5.  **Implement Frontend Canvas & Crystallization Trigger:** (Phase 1, Step 6)
    *   Build UI for reviewing `notionUpdatePayload`.
    *   Implement `/api/crystallize` endpoint and connect frontend button.

**(Subsequent phases focus on Nara mode, remaining agents, (-) cycle, frontend visualizations etc.)**

## Current Status:
**Milestone:** Backend refactored for Bimba-alignment. Core (+) QL cycle operational for text responses. Mode dispatching stubbed. Notion tool binding fix *attempted* but **untested**. Plans updated.
**Current Focus:** Preparing for testing of the refactoring and the Notion tool binding fix. Awaiting user action (recompile/restart servers) before proceeding with testing.

## Known Issues / Areas for Refinement:
*   **Notion Tool Binding (Verification Needed):** The fix applied needs testing.
*   **Notion Embedding:** Blocked by CSP. Link-based display planned as initial solution.
*   **LightRAG MCP Errors:** Neo4j timeouts and LLM compatibility errors need investigation.
*   **(-) QL Cycle:** Not implemented.
*   **Expert Agent Logic:** Placeholders exist, core logic TBD.
*   **Keyword Extraction:** Rudimentary.
*   **Nara Mode Simple Path:** Not implemented.
*   **Developer Console:** Not implemented.
*   **Data Seeding:** Requires Notion-triggered ingestion implementation.
