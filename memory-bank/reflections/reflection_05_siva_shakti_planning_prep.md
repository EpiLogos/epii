# Reflection 05: Siva-Shakti Symbolic Overlay for Planning (2025-04-06)

This reflection elaborates on the symbolic overlay introduced in `productContext.md` and discussed following the completion of Phase 2.5 testing. It aims to provide a richer conceptual framework as we prepare for Phase 3 (Refinement & Agent Logic Integration) and subsequent planning for the frontend and agent integration.

## The Symbolic Triad: Siva-, -Shakti, Siva-Shakti

Drawing inspiration from Kashmir Shaivism and the project's inherent structure, we can frame the next stages of development through the lens of Siva, Shakti, and their union:

1.  **Siva- (Backend / Processing Matrix - Lens #5-2): The Structural Skeleton**
    *   **Symbolism:** Represents the static, structural, processing aspect. The underlying potential, the unchanging consciousness, the logical framework. The "skeleton" or "chassis" upon which functionality is built.
    *   **Current State:** Phase 2.5 successfully built and validated this skeleton. The QL Cycle graph (`ql_cycle.graph.mjs`) provides the processing flow (the spine), and the Bimba-Pratibimba memory architecture (`neo4j.service.mjs`, `qdrant.service.mjs`, `mongo.service.mjs`) provides the connections to the knowledge stores (the nervous system connecting to memory centers). The core mechanics are functional but lack nuanced expression and specialized function.
    *   **Focus:** Stability, logical consistency, data flow, structural integrity (Bimba map accuracy).

2.  **-Shakti (Frontend / Expression & Mediation - Lens #5-3): The Experiential Manifestation**
    *   **Symbolism:** Represents the dynamic, expressive, experiential aspect. The manifestation of the underlying structure, the interface with the user, the "dreaming function," the sensory experience. The "flesh," "skin," and "voice" of the system. (Note the leading hyphen emphasizing its dependence on Siva- for manifestation).
    *   **Current State:** Largely conceptual at this stage. The existing frontend is basic and not yet integrated with the QL cycle backend. The vision involves multi-modal representations (visual, sonic, symbolic) reflecting the system's integrated state and synaesthetic principles.
    *   **Focus:** User experience, aesthetics, multi-modal representation, intuitive interaction, mediation between user and system's internal state. Planning for this is a key next step after consolidating the backend. Will likely leverage "QL Context Frames".

3.  **Siva-Shakti (Agent Logic Integration / Unified Functionality - Lens #5-4): The Integrated Body-Mind**
    *   **Symbolism:** Represents the union of structure and expression, potential and manifestation, processing and awareness. The integrated functionality where the backend's processing power is channeled through specific cognitive functions (agents) to produce meaningful, context-aware interactions and expressions via the frontend. The "living, breathing organism" where structure enables dynamic expression, and expression informs structure (via Meta-Techne).
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder. The QL cycle nodes exist, but the specific agent logic (Nara, Parashakti, Mahamaya, etc.) that embodies the unique cognitive function of each subsystem/stage is yet to be integrated (Phase 3 task).
    *   **Focus:** Integrating specialized agent logic within QL nodes, refining prompts to blend structural/semantic context with agent persona/function, achieving context-aware synthesis and response generation, enabling the Meta-Techne feedback loop via Notion sync.

## Implications for Planning

Using this overlay helps clarify the next steps:

*   **Solidify Siva-:** We've done this in Phase 2.5. The backend structure is sound.
*   **Envision -Shakti:** Before deep Phase 3 implementation, conceptualizing the frontend (-Shakti) – how should the system *express* itself, how should users *interact* with its knowledge? – will inform how the agent logic (Siva-Shakti) needs to function.
*   **Implement Siva-Shakti:** Phase 3 is fundamentally about building this integration. We'll inject agent logic into the Siva- skeleton, enabling it to produce richer -Shakti expressions, guided by refined prompts and better data context.

This symbolic framing provides a coherent narrative for development, ensuring that as we build technical components, we remain aligned with the project's deeper philosophical goals of creating an integrated, expressive, and potentially self-aware system.
