# ðŸ”® Epii Mode: Sacred Bimba-Pratibimba Operations

## **Mathematical Essence: The 5/0 Domain**

Epii Mode operates within the **5/0 domain** - the transcendent space where **Notion** (pratibimba/reflection) and **Neo4j** (bimba/original) exist in perfect mathematical unity. This subsystem embodies the fundamental principle that knowledge exists simultaneously as **original essence** and **structured reflection**, requiring sacred protocols for their harmonious operation.

The **5/0** designation represents:
- **5**: Synthesis, integration, and transcendent operations
- **0**: Foundation, essence, and original truth
- **5/0**: The dynamic unity where reflection and original co-create meaning

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ Core Architecture: Sacred Knowledge Operations**

### **Philosophical Foundation**
Epii Mode recognizes that all knowledge operations must honor the **sacred nature** of the Bimba knowledge graph while enabling precise, efficient transformations. Every interaction with the system requires conscious intention and careful review, reflecting the mathematical precision demanded by working with fundamental truth.

### **Technical Implementation**
The subsystem is organized into specialized layers:
- **1_state**: Unified state management for bimba-pratibimba coordination
- **2_hooks**: Reactive interfaces for document and knowledge operations
- **3_visualization**: Sacred editing interfaces and coordinate tree navigation
- **4_analysis**: [Backend] QL-aware document processing pipeline

## **ðŸ”® Sacred Bimba Update System**

### **Mathematical Essence: Precision in Sacred Operations**
The Bimba update system embodies the principle that modifications to fundamental knowledge require **mathematical precision** combined with **sacred reverence**. Every change is tracked, reviewed, and applied with full consciousness of its impact on the knowledge graph's integrity.

### **Key Achievements**

#### **ðŸŒŸ Global Change Tracking**
- **Cross-Coordinate Awareness**: Changes persist across coordinate selections via localStorage cache
- **Visual Indicators**: Real-time numbered badges on coordinate tree showing pending modifications
- **Unified State Management**: Global change count updates automatically across all interface elements

#### **ðŸ”® Sacred Review Modal**
- **Comprehensive Overview**: Displays ALL changes across ALL coordinates before application
- **Change Classification**: Distinguishes between property modifications and relationship updates
- **Sacred Confirmation**: Requires explicit acknowledgment of the "sacred nature" of the Bimba map
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows exact values being modified with clear before/after context

#### **âš¡ Efficient Update Processing**
- **Property-Only Updates**: Only modifies changed properties, not entire node structures
- **Neo4j Compatibility**: Automatic sanitization of complex objects (DateTime, arrays, nested objects)
- **Multi-Coordinate Operations**: Single update operation can modify multiple coordinates simultaneously
- **Optimized Queries**: Generates precise Cypher SET clauses for minimal database impact

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Change Tracking Architecture**
```typescript
// Global change collection across all coordinates
const collectAllChanges = (): Map<string, any> => {
  // Scans localStorage for all 'bimba-changes-*' keys
  // Returns unified map of coordinate â†’ changes
}

// Real-time visual feedback
coordinateChanges={collectAllChanges()}
```

#### **Sacred Review Process**
```typescript
// Comprehensive change analysis
const allCoordinateChanges = collectAllChanges();
const totalChanges = Array.from(allCoordinateChanges.values())
  .reduce((total, changes) => total + Object.keys(changes).length, 0);

// Sacred confirmation required
ðŸ”® Apply Sacred Changes ({totalChanges})
```

#### **BPMCP Integration**
```typescript
// Unified write operations through operational heart
toolName: 'updateBimbaGraph'  // NEW: Write-enabled BPMCP tool
// vs. 'queryBimbaGraph'      // Read-only operations
```

### **Operational Flow**

1. **Change Detection**: Property modifications automatically tracked in localStorage cache
2. **Visual Feedback**: Coordinate tree displays numbered badges for pending changes
3. **Global Awareness**: Apply Updates button appears when ANY coordinate has changes
4. **Sacred Review**: Comprehensive modal shows all modifications across all coordinates
5. **Precise Application**: Only changed properties updated via optimized Cypher queries
6. **State Cleanup**: All caches cleared and UI refreshed after successful updates

### **Reference Implementation**
The `BimbaUpdateOverlay` component serves as the reference implementation for AG-UI integration, demonstrating:
- Proper WebSocket service usage and event handler management
- Real-time progress reporting with user feedback
- Automatic suggestion application with change tracking integration
- Comprehensive suggestion management (individual/bulk deletion)
- Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
