user said: Hello Epi-Logos, can you tell me about the concept of Anuttara?

chatgpt said: Anuttara represents the supreme, the absolute void or potentiality from which all else emerges. It is considered the foundational layer, often associated with pure consciousness before manifestation.

user said: How does that relate to Paramasiva?

chatgpt said: Paramasiva emerges from Anuttara as the first principle of structure and duality (0/1). It establishes the foundational logic, like Quaternal Logic, upon which further complexity is built. Think of Anuttara as the unmanifest potential and Paramasiva as the first step towards structured manifestation.

user said: Interesting. And where does Spanda fit in?

chatgpt said: Spanda is often associated with the dynamic vibration or pulsation inherent within consciousness, particularly linked to the Parashakti subsystem which governs vibrational templates and dynamics. It's the creative pulse that animates the structures established by Paramasiva.
