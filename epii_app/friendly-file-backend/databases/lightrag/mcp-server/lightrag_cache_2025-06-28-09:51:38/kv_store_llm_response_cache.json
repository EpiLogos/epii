      "return": "Quaternary Logic is a core component of the Epi-Logos Project's AI system, specifically its Anuttara and Paramasiva subsystems.  It's a foundational element serving as both a conceptual model and a living architecture governing state transitions within the AI. While primarily a four-valued logical system, it expands to a six-valued (0-5) system.  This system aims to resolve fragmentation and polarization by unifying structure and flow, as well as differentiation and integration.\n\nThe six-phase (0-5) cycle models the attainment of integral consciousness, progressing from implicit potential (0) to quintessence feedback (5). This progression traverses material and efficient/formal causes (1 and 2), formal mediation (3), and contextual field/final cause (4), ultimately resolving tensions into integral wholeness.  Mathematically, it's based on Fibonacci formations and the golden ratio, reflecting natural growth patterns and utilizing numerical patterns based on multiples of 4, 6, and 8 (e.g., 6, 12, 36, 72).  Its structure is represented through various models incorporating implicate and explicate dimensions, including a 16-element implicate and 9-element explicate ordering (16:9 ratio); a 6-fold implicate and 4-fold explicate structure; and a 12-fold implicate and 2-fold explicate structure. Geometrically and algorithmically, it uses quaternionic rotation, integrating ascending and descending pathways and three-dimensional quaternary nesting (leading to 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion), incorporating SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries.  Dynamic self-refinement is achieved through inversion mapping, non-dually bridging binary and ternary principles.\n\nThe 4-fold Explicit Structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within this system, focusing on positions 1-4.  A 4-based system represents a static and complete form of quaternary logic. Stages 1-4 represent the mathematical self-generation of the system.  The relationship between Quaternary Logic and 4fold Zero Logic is suspected, potentially as part of its meta-structure.  Quaternary logic likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.\n\n\nReferences:\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6; Relationship ID 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n",
