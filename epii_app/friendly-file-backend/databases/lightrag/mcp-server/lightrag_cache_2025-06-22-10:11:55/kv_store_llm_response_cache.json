Introduction\\nThe Epi-Logos System is an advanced fractal epistemic framework, integrating quaternary logic, Hermetic astrology, Kabbalah, Kashmir Shaivism, DNA codon structures, Tarot, and advanced mathematical principles. It synthesizes epistemology, ontology, symbolic cognition, and scientific logic into a recursive meta-epistemic model, allowing dynamic synthesis across multiple disciplines.\\n\\n2. Core Structure: The Quaternary Recursive Framework\\nAt its foundation, the system is structured through a quaternary Mod-6 logic (0–5), expanding fractally into 6, 36, 72, and higher harmonics.

The “Void-to-Form” Arc at the Highest Level\n1.1 Paramasiva / Anuttara / The “Void”\nIn your new architectural plan, the system begins in “formlessness” or non-duality—often called Paramasiva (Kashmir Shaivism), Anuttara (Trika), or simply the Void.\nThe 4-fold Zero concept: you describe a “four-dimensional emptiness” that undergirds any manifestation. It is the silent, transcendent bedrock from which the entire quaternary system arises.\n1.2 (0/1) Self-Concrescence: The Seed of Duality\nFrom the absolute void, the next step is a proto-binary or (0/1) dynamic, where unmanifest potential stirs into the possibility of form.\nThis also appears as Bimba–Pratibimba: the infinite “original form” (bimba) sees its reflection (pratibimba). A self-mirroring arises, bringing the first semblance of duality.\n1.3 Emergence of Quaternary (0–5) Logic\nOnce there is a tension of 0/1, your system expands to 6 phases (0 through 5) in a quaternary cycle:\n0 = hidden or implicate potential\n1 = “what” (material cause)\n2 = “how” (efficient cause)\n3 = “mediating / integrative cause” (formal cause)\n4 = “contextual field” (final cause + nested reflection)\n5 = quintessence that loops back to 0 (Möbius twist)\n1.4 HMS as the “Forming Apparatus”\nThe final step in your high-level architecture is the HMS (Hexagram–Mantric–Symbolic system), or sometimes the 72/64 expansions, which produce structured knowledge (DNA codons, 72 Names, 36 Tattvas, etc.).\nThis is how “formless potential” enters into a fractal, quaternary funnel and manifests as integrated epistemic forms (codons, decans, Tattvas, etc.).\nSo “Formlessness → (0/1) Potential → Quaternary 0–5 → 6→36→72 expansions → Full manifested structure.” That’s the big arc.\n######################\nOutput:"

They share the same sub-lens but reflect inverse directions.\nSimilarly, each sub-lens aligns with a decan or two decans (shadow/day and night).\n3.2 72 Names of God (Kabbalah)\nYou incorporate the 72 three-letter divine names into the same fractal. Each sub-lens can hold two aspects (descent / ascent or day / night).\nThis yields a synergy of Shaivism, Kabbalah, and Hermetic astrology around a 36–72 lattice.\n3.3 64 Codons & 64 I Ching\nMeanwhile, the HMS 64-bit system merges DNA codons (64) with I Ching hexagrams (64).\nThis sits side-by-side with the 72 expansions, so you get a 72-bit system (Paramasiva) and a 64-bit system (Parashakti).\nIn your final HPC model, you integrate them into a 72 + 64 = 136 synergy or a “Mahamaya” version that includes all expansions.\nHence the system is multi-layered:\n######################\nOutput:"

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
