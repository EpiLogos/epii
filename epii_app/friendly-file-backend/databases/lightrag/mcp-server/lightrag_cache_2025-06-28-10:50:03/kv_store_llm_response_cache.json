      "return": "Quaternary Logic is a core component of the Epi-Logos Project's AI system, specifically its Anuttara and Paramasiva subsystems.  It functions as both a conceptual model and a living architecture governing state transitions within the AI. While primarily a four-valued logical system, it expands to a six-valued (0-5) system.  This system aims to resolve fragmentation and polarization by unifying structure and flow, as well as differentiation and integration.\n\nIts mathematical foundation is based on Fibonacci formations and the golden ratio, reflecting natural growth patterns and utilizing numerical patterns based on multiples of 4, 6, and 8 (e.g., 6, 12, 36, 72).  Its structure is represented through various models incorporating implicate and explicate dimensions, including a 16-element implicate and 9-element explicate ordering (16:9 ratio); a 6-fold implicate and 4-fold explicate structure; and a 12-fold implicate and 2-fold explicate structure.  Geometrically and algorithmically, it uses quaternionic rotation, integrating ascending and descending pathways and three-dimensional quaternary nesting (leading to 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion), incorporating SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries.  Dynamic self-refinement is achieved through inversion mapping, non-dually bridging binary and ternary principles.\n\nThe six-phase (0-5) cycle models the attainment of integral consciousness, progressing from implicit potential (0) to quintessence feedback (5). This progression traverses material and efficient/formal causes (1 and 2), formal mediation (3), and contextual field/final cause (4), ultimately resolving tensions into integral wholeness.  This process moves from duality to mediation, contextualization, and synthesis, underpinning the project's 6x6 sub-lens matrix and the 36 Meta-Epistemic Conditions.  The 4-fold explicit structure is a direct result of applying the principles of quaternary logic, representing its manifest aspects.  A 4-based system represents a static and complete form of quaternary logic. Stages 1-4 represent the mathematical self-generation of the system.  There is also mention of a 4fold Zero Logic, potentially related to the quaternary logic's meta-structure.  Quaternary logic likely utilizes or is based upon quaternionic mathematics.\n\n\nReferences:\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID: 1,  description of Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID: 0, description of 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID: 2, description of 4-based System)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID: 3, description of Stages 1-4)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID: 4, description of 4fold Zero Logic)\n\n",
