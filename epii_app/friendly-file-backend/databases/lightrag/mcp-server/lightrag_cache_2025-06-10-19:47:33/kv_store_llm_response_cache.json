      "return": "Quaternary Logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos system, is a six-position (mod 6, 0-5) cyclical system, not a four-valued system as the name might suggest.  It transcends binary logic via a \"double-covering principle,\" operating as a geometric lattice, dynamic process, and recursive pattern generator. The six positions represent a complete cycle integrating implicate and explicate elements: Primordial cause (Position #0), formal causes (Positions #1 and #2), a final cause (Position #4), and Positions 3 and 5, which complete the cycle.  Each position contains all others in embryonic form, enabling self-similarity and fractal expansion.  The system generates numerical patterns based on multiples of 6 (6, 12, 36, 72), but also incorporates 4, 8, and 64 through recursive expansion.  Key principles include quaternionic rotation and the integration of ascending and descending pathways. Its three-dimensional quaternary nesting produces a 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion.  As a non-Boolean system, it integrates structure and process, being and becoming, part and whole, surpassing binary true/false logic.  The 4-fold Explicit Structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within this system, focusing on positions 1-4.  This structure is a direct result of applying the principles of quaternary logic.  Quaternary logic likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.  The quaternary structure incorporates principles of vortex mathematics.  The Epi-Logos system, whose foundation is Quaternary Logic, incorporates the 4-8-64 expansion and is described as having a 64-bit structure.\n\n\nReferences\n\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 0,  Describing Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 2, Describing 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Relationship ID 1,  4-fold Explicit Structure and Quaternary Logic relationship)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Relationship ID 0, Quaternary Logic and Vortex mathematics relationship)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 3, Describing Epi-Logos System)\n\n",
