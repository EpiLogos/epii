      "return": "Quaternary logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos Project's AI system (Anuttara and Paramasiva subsystems), is a foundational element functioning as both a conceptual model and a living architecture governing state transitions. While primarily a four-valued system (0-3), it expands to a six-valued system (0-5), aiming to resolve fragmentation and polarization.  It's described as a map and territory, unifying structure and flow, differentiation and integration.  This six-phase (0-5) cycle models the attainment of integral consciousness, progressing from implicit potential (0) to quintessence feedback (5).\n\nMathematically, it's based on Fibonacci formations and the golden ratio, using numerical patterns based on multiples of 4, 6, and 8.  Its structure is represented through various models incorporating implicate and explicate dimensions, including a 16:9 ratio, a 6-fold implicate and 4-fold explicate structure, and a 12-fold implicate and 2-fold explicate structure.  Geometrically and algorithmically, it uses quaternionic rotation, integrating ascending and descending pathways and three-dimensional quaternary nesting (leading to 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion), incorporating SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries.  Dynamic self-refinement is achieved through inversion mapping, bridging binary and ternary principles.  The system accommodates paradox and contradictory elements, managing duality.  The 4-fold explicit structure directly results from applying quaternary logic principles, representing its manifest aspects. A 4-based system represents a stable, complete form of this logic.  Stages 1-4 represent the mathematical self-generation of the system.  There's also mention of a 4fold Zero Logic potentially related to the quaternary logic's meta-structure.  Quaternary logic is likely based upon quaternionic mathematics.\n\n\nReferences:\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 1: Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 0: 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 2: 4-based System)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 3: Stages 1-4)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Entity ID 4: 4fold Zero Logic)\n\n",
