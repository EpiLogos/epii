      "return": "Quaternary Logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos system, is a six-position (mod 6, 0-5) cyclical systemâ€”not a four-valued system as the name might suggest.  It transcends binary logic via a \"double-covering principle,\" operating simultaneously as a geometric lattice, a dynamic process, and a recursive pattern generator. The six positions represent a complete cycle integrating implicate and explicate elements: Primordial cause (Position #0), formal causes (Positions #1 and #2), a final cause (Position #4), and Positions 3 and 5, which complete the cycle.  Each position contains all others in embryonic form, enabling self-similarity, infinite development, and fractal expansion; the completion of one cycle initiates another.\n\nThe system generates numerical patterns primarily based on multiples of 6 (6, 12, 36, 72), but also incorporates 4, 8, and 64 through recursive expansion, resulting in structures with 12, 36, and 72 elements.  Key principles include quaternionic rotation and the integration of ascending and descending pathways. Its three-dimensional quaternary nesting produces a 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion, underpinned by mathematical and geometric principles based on groups of four, including double covering, recursive nesting, and parallel tracks.  As a non-Boolean system, it integrates structure and process, being and becoming, part and whole, surpassing binary true/false logic by incorporating multiple states.  It includes implicit themes, latent potential, and manifest operations.\n\nThe 4-fold Explicit Structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within the quaternary logic system, focusing on positions 1-4. This structure is a direct result of applying the principles of quaternary logic and is a foundational component, representing its manifest aspects.  Quaternary Logic incorporates principles of vortex mathematics, and it is the mathematical foundation of the Epi-Logos System.  It likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.  The Epi-Logos system uses a 64-bit structure and is described as having a 4-8-64 expansion.\n\n\nReferences\n\n* [KG] api_ingest (Describes Quaternary Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Describes the 4-fold Explicit Structure)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Describes the relationship between Quaternary Logic and Vortex mathematics)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Describes the relationship between Epi-Logos System and Quaternal Logic)\n* [KG] api_ingest (Describes the relationship between Quaternary logic and Quaternionic mathematics)\n\n",
