      "return": "Quaternary Logic, a core component of the Epi-Logos system, is a six-position (mod 6, 0-5) cyclical systemâ€”not a four-valued system as the name might suggest.  It transcends binary logic via a \"double-covering principle,\" operating simultaneously as a geometric lattice, a dynamic process, and a recursive pattern generator. The six positions represent a complete cycle integrating implicate (hidden/transcendent) and explicate (manifest/immanent) elements: Primordial cause (Position #0), formal causes (Positions #1 and #2), a final cause (Position #4), and Positions 3 and 5, which complete the cycle. Each position contains all others in embryonic form, enabling self-similarity, infinite development, and fractal expansion; the completion of one cycle initiates another.  The system generates numerical patterns primarily based on multiples of 6 (6, 12, 36, 72), but also incorporates 4, 8, and 64 through recursive expansion.  Key principles include quaternionic rotation and the integration of ascending and descending pathways. Its three-dimensional quaternary nesting produces a 4-fold, 8-fold, and 64-fold expansion, underpinned by mathematical and geometric principles based on groups of four, including double covering, recursive nesting, and parallel tracks.  As a non-Boolean system, it integrates structure and process, being and becoming, part and whole, surpassing binary true/false logic by incorporating multiple states.  It includes implicit themes, latent potential, and manifest operations.  The 4-fold Explicit Structure represents the manifest aspects of a cycle within the quaternary logic system, focusing on positions 1-4.  This structure is a direct result of applying the principles of quaternary logic.  Quaternary Logic incorporates principles of vortex mathematics.  It is the mathematical foundation of the Epi-Logos System, a system that transcends conventional binary thinking.  It likely utilizes or is based upon the principles of quaternionic mathematics.
