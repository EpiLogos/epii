For the first stage (Void), “0.0” is the ultimate Real. For the last stage (Epi mind-body), the synergy (5.5) or the “0.0” in ascending sense is again that same Real—closing the loop. All told, that’s 36 vantage points in a single “descend–ascend” cycle, consistent with your description of how each system’s “0” is the prior system’s vantage or the transcendental living consciousness at the extremes.\n######################\nOutput:"
