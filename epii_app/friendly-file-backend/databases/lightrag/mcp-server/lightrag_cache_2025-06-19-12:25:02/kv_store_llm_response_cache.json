(Overall Project Structure)\\nTotal Nodes: Unknown\\n\\n\\n# The Resonant Architecture of Life: An Integrated Synthesis of Cymatics, Bioacoustics, and Molecular Vibration\\n\\nThis comprehensive exploration synthesizes current research on vibrational phenomena across multiple domains—from visible sound patterns in water to dolphin communication and DNA-water interactions. The evidence suggests profound connections between vibrational signatures and physical form, with sound waves demonstrating remarkable structuring effects on matter from the molecular to the macroscopic level. While some theoretical connections remain speculative, established research indicates that vibration serves as a fundamental language through which information and energy flow between different systems and scales of reality.\\n\\n## The Science of Cymatics: Visible Sound Patterns\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Epi-Logos Project\\\"<|>\\\"project\\\"<|>\\\"The Epi-Logos Project is a comprehensive framework encompassing various subsystems, including Anuttara, Paramasiva, Parashakti, Mahamaya, Nara, and epii.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
