# Hermetic Decans

**Origins and Structure:** _Decans_ are ten-degree divisions of the Zodiac, each comprising a distinct sub-influence within a sign. The concept arose in ancient **Egypt**: the Egyptians divided the year into 36 ten-day periods, each ruled by a star/deity (the “_decan_” stars). Hellenistic and Hermetic astrologers adopted these as 36 astrological segments, **assigning them to the zodiac signs (3 decans per sign)**​

. In Hermetic lore, the decans were seen not only as subdivisions of zodiacal degrees but as **spiritual intelligences or gods** governing those degrees​

. _“The decans…were really Egyptian sidereal gods of time…affiliated to the zodiac…They all had images…and definite astrological significance, presiding over life born under them…they were also gods, powerful Egyptian gods”_​

.

Each decan has a traditional **planetary rulership** determined by the classical “Chaldean order” of planets. In this scheme, starting from 0° Aries, the rulers cycle in the sequence **Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter**, then repeat every seven decans​

. (Thus Aries’ three decans are ruled by Mars, Sun, Venus; Taurus by Mercury, Moon, Saturn; Gemini by Jupiter, Mars, Sun; and so on in a continuous loop.) These are also known as the planet’s “faces” – a concept in medieval astrology where each decan is a face of a planet. The decan’s planetary lord adds a specific flavor **distinct from the sign’s main ruler**, yielding finer astrological distinctions. For example, the first decan of Aries is Mars-ruled (Martian qualities intensify in early Aries), the second decan of Aries is Sun-ruled (introducing solar qualities to mid-Aries), etc. This systemic structure underlies decanic attributions in texts like _Picatrix_ and Agrippa’s _Three Books of Occult Philosophy_, and was later adopted by Golden Dawn astrologers​

**Iconography and Mythic Figures:** A unique feature of Hermetic decans is the **imagery** associated with each. In Graeco-Egyptian and medieval magical texts, each decan is represented by a **symbolic figure** – often a fantastical or composite being – that embodies the decan’s qualities. For instance, the _Picatrix_ (an influential 11th-century Arabic grimoire of astrological magic) describes vivid decan images used for talismans​

. These icons frequently have mythic overtones: human-animal hybrids, god-like warriors, or bizarre creatures, each **rich in symbolic meaning**. Over centuries, authors linked decans to various deities or spirits: e.g. in one tradition Aries’ second decan is ascribed to **Persephone**, in another to **Anubis**, reflecting themes of descent and return (fitting as Aries II’s image is a one-legged woman who goes beneath the earth)​

. The **Liber Hermetis** (a Latin astrological text) even gives Hebrew names for decan spirits (e.g. Aries II is ruled by _Tzabaoth_, meaning “Hosts/Armies”) alongside its image​

. Thus, decans were seen as _archetypal forces_, often personified by gods (Egyptian, Greco-Roman, or Chaldean) or angelic beings. Hermetic practitioners treated these figures as **magical intermediaries** – by crafting images or invocations of a decan’s figure, one could tap into the decan’s particular energy in astral magic​

**Light and Shadow Qualities:** Each decan is believed to exert distinct influences, which can manifest as **“light” or “shadow”** traits (positive vs. negative potentials). Astrological texts often describe what _the person or event under that decan will be like_ – sometimes in flattering terms (strengths, virtues), sometimes unflattering (vices, misfortunes). In other words, **each decan has a specific essence** that can tilt towards constructive or destructive expression. For example, one decan may confer courage and leadership when positive, but arrogance or violence when negative. The magical images encapsulate these dual potentials: an image might appear beneficent or fearsome depending on the decan’s nature. In _Picatrix_ and Agrippa’s summaries, we often see phrasing like _“this face signifies [list of good traits] and [list of bad traits]”_. Below is a structured look at **all 36 decans**, listing their **planetary ruler, iconography, and noted light vs. shadow qualities** as drawn from classical sources:

- **Aries (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Mars_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Aries)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** A fierce black warrior figure with red eyes, wielding an axe and clothed in white​

        . **Attributes:** Ambition for **power and prosperity**, nobility, and charisma (**light**); on the flip side, impatience or overreach in pursuit of status (**shadow**). This face is noted as a “**face of high rank, nobility, wealth and rulership**”​

        . The woman’s missing leg symbolizes _partial handicap overcome by determination_, reflecting Aries II’s theme of **perseverance leading to success**. (Some esoteric correspondences link this decan to underworld mythos – e.g. Persephone’s cyclic journey – hinting at hidden strength and renewal​

- **Taurus (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Venus_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Taurus)** – **Ruler:** Mercury. **Iconography:** A woman with curly hair in **fiery-colored clothes**, holding her child. Both wear garments glowing like embers​

        . It can indicate experiences of suffering or hard karma (Saturn’s influence). However, positively it can confer great **endurance and patience** in adversity (**light** quality being the fortitude to bear burdens). The bizarre composite image conveys the weight and toil associated with late Taurus when inertia is strongest.

        . **Light qualities:** creativity, learning, versatility, generosity (Jupiter’s expansiveness in communicative Gemini). **Shadow:** can manifest as restlessness or dilettantism if the wealth of ideas is not focused. Overall it’s a fortunate face, promoting **knowledge and balanced exchange**.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Gemini)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** A man with a **griffin’s face**, wearing a turban and armored with leaden shield and iron helmet adorned by a crown​

        . **Light:** courage, initiative, cutting through obstacles. **Shadow:** “reckless haste” – rushing into conflict or conflicts of ego (Mars) that backfire. The griffin imagery underscores aggressive vigilance and pride.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Gemini)** – **Ruler:** Sun. **Iconography:** A man armed with bow and quiver, _in motion_ (one text shows him wearing a shield)​

        . **Attributes:** This phase brings a more playful but unfocused energy. It “indicates **overlooking** things that should be noticed, **fun and entertainment**, and **unemployment**”​

        . Essentially, **light side** is sociability, humor, enjoyment of life; **shadow side** is negligence, frivolity, or failure to capitalize on opportunities. It’s as if the brilliance of the Sun in Gemini III produces talent and charm, but also distractibility or indulgence in pleasures over duties.
- **Cancer (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Moon_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Cancer)** – **Ruler:** Venus. **Iconography:** A man with a **horse-like face and fingers**, white feet, and covered in leaves​

        . **Light:** kindness, artistic sensibility, humor, courtesy. It’s a gentle, sociable influence (Venus in Cancer’s nurturing mode). **Shadow:** can be overly sensitive or vain in appearance, but generally this face is positive (the image blending human and animal suggests **playfulness and connection to the natural world**).
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Cancer)** – **Ruler:** Mercury. **Iconography:** A beautiful **woman singing**, wearing a wreath of green basil and holding a water-lily rod​

        . **Attributes:** **Joy, music, and grace.** It denotes “entertainment and enjoyment of music,” as well as **grace, honor, and wealth**​

        . **Light:** emotional expression, delight in arts, social grace, and even material comfort (Cancer’s fruitful side). **Shadow:** frivolity or dependence on pleasures. Overall it’s a face of **happiness and prosperity**, Mercury lending curiosity and skill in fine arts.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Cancer)** – **Ruler:** Moon. **Iconography:** A man with one foot like a turtle’s, holding a **snake**, and adorned with gold jewelry​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2014)
        
        . **Attributes:** _Picatrix_ calls this a phase of “**tricks, forceful expulsion, achieving objectives by fighting, struggle and repulsion**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Hannah%20Astarte%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO)
        
        . The **shadow** side is strong: it can indicate deceit, emotional turmoil, and conflict (the snake and defensive stance symbolize this). Yet its **light side** is tenacity and strategic shrewdness – the ability to “drive away” negativity or enemies. The Moon ruling its own decan here gives deep instinct and psychic skill, which can protect (golden armor) or, if misused, manipulate.
- **Leo (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Sun_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Leo)** – **Ruler:** Saturn. **Iconography:** A man in dirty clothes, alongside a wolfish cavalryman and a watchdog, all gazing north​

        . **Attributes:** Surprisingly for Saturn in Leo, this face is considered “complete in form and nature” and denotes **strength, rescue, stamina, action, attack and triumph**​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Hannah%20Astarte%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO)
        
        . It’s a **martial Saturn**: **light qualities** include courage, reliability, the strength to overcome adversity (the “rescuer” aspect). **Shadow:** severity, harshness in pursuit of victory, or stoicism to the point of joylessness. The imagery of predatory animals suggests **fight-or-flight survival energy**, which when positively channeled gives heroic endurance, and when negative can be merciless.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Leo)** – **Ruler:** Jupiter. **Iconography:** A man crowned with white basil, holding an arrow​

        . **Attributes:** A face of **fanaticism or misdirected zeal**. It “indicates **heresy, ignorance, confusion, idleness of fools, and the drawing of swords in fighting**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Hannah%20Astarte%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,decan%20FRESCOES%20OF%20THE%20DECANS)
        
        . **Shadow side:** dogmatism, folly, and needless conflict – perhaps **misguided idealism** (Jupiter’s belief energy warped in Leo’s pride). However, its **light** aspect could be a kind of brute courage or unorthodox innovation (willingness to defy norms – hence “heresy” – which can lead to new insight). This decan’s lesson is tempering conviction with wisdom.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Leo)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** An “ugly” dark-complexioned man, with fruit and meat in his mouth and carrying a kettle​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2017)
        
        . **Attributes:** Despite the crude image, this decan’s influence is surprisingly **harmonious and sociable**. It is said to signify **friendliness, rewards, affection, participation and harmony**​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2017)
        
        . **Light:** generosity, celebration (sharing food and community, as the image suggests), the **harvest of good karma** (rewards). **Shadow:** overindulgence, gluttony, or lack of refinement. Overall, this Mars face in Leo shows the _protective, convivial side of Mars_ – defending one’s community, feasting after battles – aligning with fellowship and loyalty.
- **Virgo (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Mercury_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Virgo)** – **Ruler:** Sun. **Iconography:** A modest **maiden in an old dress**, holding a pomegranate​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2018)
        
        . **Attributes:** **Agriculture, wealth, and righteousness.** It denotes “plowing and planting, grasses and plants, buildings and wealth, and righteousness”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Hannah%20Astarte%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2018)
        
        . Clearly a **productivity and integrity** theme – **light qualities** are diligence in work, generosity (sharing abundance), and moral virtue. **Shadow tendencies** could be workaholism or self-righteousness, but generally this face is seen as abundantly positive (the pomegranate symbolizes fertility and wisdom). It is the **earth-goddess** aspect of Virgo (akin to Demeter or the Virgin holding the harvest).
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Virgo)** – **Ruler:** Venus. **Iconography:** A well-colored man wearing animal skins and iron clothing​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2019)
        
        . **Attributes:** Hard work and frugality. _Picatrix_ says this phase depicts “working, making a living, saving,” but also **stinginess and depriving others**​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2019)
        
        . **Light side:** thrift, endurance, practical skills – the ability to **earn and conserve wealth**. **Shadow side:** miserliness, lack of charity or joy (Venus’s warmth is present but restrained by earthy pragmatism). This decan balances **productivity with caution**; when balanced it yields sustainable success, when imbalanced it can become greed and exploitation.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Virgo)** – **Ruler:** Mercury. **Iconography:** A large pale man wrapped in rope, and a woman holding a black fawn to be sacrificed by a magus​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2020)
        
        . **Attributes:** _Picatrix_ calls this a phase of **decline and destruction**: “old age, weakness, immobility, chronic illness, uprooting of trees and destruction of buildings.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2020)
        
        **Shadow side:** strongly evident – decay, disease, endings. The imagery of sacrifice and entrapment (rope) underscores loss and hardship. **Light side:** the wisdom of age, the power to **eradicate corruption** (uproot diseased trees, etc.). This face perhaps teaches **acceptance of mortality and change**. In a natal chart it might indicate someone who works with death or decay in a transformative way. (Being Mercury-ruled, it could also signify deep analytical ability born from suffering.)
- **Libra (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Venus_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Libra)** – **Ruler:** Moon. **Iconography:** A man holding an arrow in one hand and an upside-down bird in the other​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Schifanoia%20SIGN%20OF%20THE%20ZODIAC,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2021)
        
        . **Attributes:** The **principles of justice and protection**. This phase is “a phase of legitimacy, justice, fairness, and protection of the weak from tyrants,” and is “complete in form and nature”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Schifanoia%20SIGN%20OF%20THE%20ZODIAC,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2021)
        
        . **Light:** great fairness, **championing the underdog**, balance of forces (the quintessential Libran virtues of justice and peace). There is hardly a shadow mentioned, except perhaps that an “upside-down bird” could warn against disrupted freedom if justice fails. Generally, this is one of the most benefic decans – **righteous leadership** and social harmony are its gifts.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Libra)** – **Ruler:** Saturn. **Iconography:** A black man leading a wedding procession​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2022)
        
        . **Attributes:** **Ease, luxury, and stability.** It is a “phase of relaxation, wealth, good living, security, peacefulness and easy living.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Hannah%20Astarte%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2022)
        
        **Light side:** enjoying the fruits of labor, domestic harmony, and **material comfort**. Saturn’s rulership adds permanence and structure to Venusian Libra – hence long-lasting peace or marriage (the wedding imagery). **Shadow side:** complacency or laziness that can come with too much ease. But overall this decan suggests **prosperity and contentment**, aligning with Libra’s social bliss.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Libra)** – **Ruler:** Jupiter. **Iconography:** A man riding a donkey with a predatory beast before him​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,DECANS%20%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN)
        
        . (The text transitions here to Scorpio, but for Libra III it states:) This is the phase of Jupiter, indicating “**sinfulness, impudence, sodomy, singing, entertainment and enjoyment**.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,DECANS%20%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN)
        
        A mixed bag of meanings – **Shadow:** immoral or taboo indulgences (the references to impudence and sodomy), and irreverence. **Light:** creativity, performance, and joy (singing, entertainment). Essentially, this decan’s energy is **dissipated fun vs. excess**. Jupiter expands Libra’s love of pleasure; if virtue is lacking, it can become debauchery, but with some wisdom it could channel into the arts and merriment. The image of a man on a donkey chasing a beast might symbolize folly chasing vice.
- **Scorpio (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Mars_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Scorpio)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** A man holding arrows in both hands​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=front%20of%20him%20appears%20in,PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%20IMAGE%20DELETED%2023)
        
        . **Attributes:** Intense and victorious. It’s said to be Mars-ruled “complete in form and nature,” indicating **honor, glory, cunning, and triumph**​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=3rd%20decan%20SCORPIO%201st%20decan,PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%20IMAGE%20DELETED%2023)
        
        . **Light:** strategic genius, bravery, and the **ability to overcome enemies** (very martial and potent – Scorpio’s famed resourcefulness and determination are at peak here). **Shadow:** manipulation or excessive aggressiveness (cunning can turn to deceit). Overall this decan confers **power and success in conflict**, the classic warrior-victor energy.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Scorpio)** – **Ruler:** Sun. **Iconography:** A man on a camel holding a scorpion​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,picture%20of%20three%20bodies%3B%20the)
        
        . **Attributes:** This face “indicates **disgrace, scandal, tragedy and anger**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,picture%20of%20three%20bodies%3B%20the)
        
        . **Shadow side:** strongly pronounced – falls from grace, intense rage or betrayal (the scorpion symbolizing the sting of injury or revenge). It can manifest as personal downfall or public scandal. **Light side:** hard to find, but possibly the courage to face tragedy or a radical transformation through crisis (the Sun in Scorpio can illuminate deep truths through destruction). The camel suggests endurance through a barren period. Caution is needed with this decan’s volatile emotional energy.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Scorpio)** – **Ruler:** Venus. **Iconography:** A horse and a snake appear, and elsewhere an image of a man subduing a woman (from the text: “an evil man with a woman before him, a donkey above her” – likely symbolic)​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%20SCORPIO%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,%C2%BB%20IMAGE%20DELETED%20%C2%ABThe)
        
        . **Attributes:** This decan carries themes of **debauchery and forceful passions**. It “indicates sinfulness, impudence and **violent sexual domination** (forceful marital sex by subduing)”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%20SCORPIO%20%C2%ABThe%20image%20of,phase%20of%20Mercury%2C%20and%20it)
        
        . **Shadow:** clearly, lustful excess, abuse of power in sexuality, and moral transgression. **Light side:** passionate intensity and depth of feeling – if refined, it could be profound love or tantric transformation, but texts emphasize the dangerous aspects. Essentially, this face is the **dark erotic** side of Scorpio. It warns of being consumed by desire and the need to tame one’s inner “snake/horse” instincts.
- **Sagittarius (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Jupiter_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Sagittarius)** – **Ruler:** Mercury. **Iconography:** Three human figures – one red, one white, one red – perhaps indicating balance of humors​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=horse%20and%20a%20snake%20appears,2nd%20decan%20SCORPIO%203rd%20decan)
        
        . **Attributes:** A valorous and active influence. It “indicates **valor, activity, pleasure, patience and chivalry**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=subduing%20and%20anger,OF%20THE%20DECANS%20%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI)
        
        . **Light:** optimism, adventurous spirit, courage (Sagittarian fire channeled through Mercury’s agility, giving noble action). **Shadow:** perhaps overzealousness or foolhardy quests, but overall this face is positive. It combines physical energy with mental agility, suggesting a **knight-errant** archetype – brave, honorable, and willing to endure (patience) for a worthy cause.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Sagittarius)** – **Ruler:** Moon. **Iconography:** A man driving cows, with a monkey and wolf ahead of him​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=the%20first%20phase%20of%20Sagittarius,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2024)
        
        . **Attributes:** This phase “indicates **fright, loss, weeping, fear, sadness, and violence**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=indicates%20valor%2C%20activity%2C%20pleasure%2C%20patience,MESI%C2%BB%20IN%20PALAZZO%20SCHIFANOIA%2024)
        
        . Clearly the **shadow side** is prominent: emotional turmoil, danger, and setbacks. The imagery suggests one trying to herd (control) but being led by wild or foolish forces (monkey, wolf) – implying loss of control. **Light side:** perhaps instinctual **reflection and caution**; this decan can impart deep intuition through pain, and empathy born from suffering. In general, though, it is seen as a challenging face where **hopes are tested** by crises or betrayals (Moon in a fire sign can show emotional volatility).
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Sagittarius)** – **Ruler:** Saturn. **Iconography:** A man with a golden cap **killing another man**​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Schifanoia%20Hannah%20Astarte%20SIGN%20OF,%C2%BB)
        
        . **Attributes:** Extreme and unwise actions. It “indicates taking risks, unwarranted involvement, and exerting effort in disgraceful, shameful, or harmful acts”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=Schifanoia%20Hannah%20Astarte%20SIGN%20OF,of%20him%20appears%20in%20the)
        
        . This is a decidedly **shadowy decan** – the impulse to go “all in” on a destructive course. **Shadow:** violence, gambling with one’s fate, and engaging in immoral deeds that lead to downfall. **Light:** the capacity for unflinching action – if somehow guided by righteousness, it could be self-sacrifice or eliminating great evil (though texts don’t emphasize any positive here). Essentially, this is the **reckless adventurer** or fanatic: when Sagittarius’ vision is corrupted and Saturn’s severity misapplied, dangerous outcomes result. Caution and ethical clarity are needed to redeem this decan’s intensity.
- **Capricorn (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Saturn_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Capricorn)** – **Ruler:** Jupiter. **Iconography:** A man with a cane in one hand and a hoop in the other​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=killing%20another%20man%20appears%20in,This%20phase%20delineates%20seeking%20what)
        
        . **Attributes:** Restless ambition tempered by limitation. It “indicates **pleasure, activity, going back and forth, incapability, weakness, and humility**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=disgraceful%2C%20shameful%20and%20harmful%20actions,DELETED%203rd%20decan%20CAPRICORN%201st)
        
        . This face mingles **light and shadow**: **light side** – industry, movement, a drive to attain enjoyment; **shadow side** – acknowledged weakness or humble status despite efforts. The native may toil vigorously (hoop rolling suggests repeated effort) yet feel their labor is Sisyphean. Positively, it grants **resilience and humility**, willingness to keep trying; negatively, frustration and a sense of inadequacy. Jupiter’s optimism is present but Saturn (Capricorn) imposes realism, yielding a character of **hopeful toil**.
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Capricorn)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** A man with a monkey before him​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=pleasure%2C%20activity%2C%20going%20back%20and,DECANS%20%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN)
        
        . **Attributes:** Seeking something unattainable. It is described as “delineating the pursuit of what is known but **unobtainable**”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=pleasure%2C%20activity%2C%20going%20back%20and,DECANS%20%C2%ABSALONE%20DEI%20MESI%C2%BB%20IN)
        
        . **Shadow:** fruitless quests, obsession over an idea or goal out of reach (the monkey may symbolize a tantalizing aim or trickster leading one on). **Light:** the courage to attempt the impossible, which can lead to innovation or discovery of one’s limits. There’s a quixotic quality here – Mars provides energy and drive, but Capricorn’s terrain makes the climb steep. This decan teaches perseverance even when success is doubtful, yet warns against stubborn folly.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Capricorn)** – **Ruler:** Sun. **Iconography:** (Text fragment mentions a man opening and closing a book (Qur’an) with a fish tail before him​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=second%20phase%20and%20this%20is,DELETED%203rd%20decan%20CAPRICORN%201st)
        
        , but the description was cut off.) We can infer attributes: likely a mix of spirituality and material concerns. Some sources equate Capricorn III with themes of **spiritual authority vs. material loss**. It might indicate **poverty in spite of wisdom**, or oscillation between faith and pragmatism. Lacking the direct text, one could say **light side**: deep spiritual insight (Sun’s illumination in Saturn’s sign, the sage depicted reading holy scripture); **shadow side**: isolation, austerity, and sorrow (fish out of water image, perhaps). _[Because the source text is incomplete, this decan’s specifics are not fully detailed here]_.
- **Aquarius (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Saturn_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Aquarius)** – **Ruler:** Venus. **Iconography:** A **beheaded man** holding a peacock​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%203rd%20decan%20and%20it,This%20phase%20denotes)
        
        . **Attributes:** Struggle and toil with little reward. “It is the phase of hard and tiring work, poverty, need, and scant means of subsistence.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%203rd%20decan%20and%20it,This%20phase%20denotes)
        
        **Shadow:** hardship, decapitation symbolizing loss of status or clear direction; vanity (peacock) cut short. **Light:** humility, diligence, and spiritual beauty hidden by material lack. Aquarius’s idealism is present but Venus’s abundance is denied materially – perhaps yielding inner riches instead. This decan often produces humanitarians or inventors who suffer poverty or lack recognition in their time (**light** in their altruism, **shadow** in their personal deprivation).
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Aquarius)** – **Ruler:** Mercury. **Iconography:** A tenacious man appearing like a mighty king​

        . This face brings out **Aquarius’s visionary leadership** quality. **Light:** intellectual brilliance, humanitarian nobility, and a well-rounded character (strong mind and body). It suggests the **ideal ruler or sage-king archetype**. **Shadow:** perhaps pride or eccentricity, but the text emphasizes virtues. In effect, this decan fuses Mercury’s intelligence with Saturnian profundity, producing **“complete religion”** (meaning a full understanding of truth) and integrity​

    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Aquarius)** – **Ruler:** Moon. **Iconography:** A beheaded man with an old woman in front of him​

        . **Attributes:** “This phase denotes **ugliness, bad reputation and scandal**.”​

        **Shadow:** public disgrace, loss of honor, and the haunting of past mistakes (the old woman could symbolize old karma or shame that one can’t escape). **Light:** detachment from need for approval – Aquarius is the outsider, and this decan may bestow the power to **break social conventions** at the cost of reputation, which sometimes is necessary for innovation. However, generally it’s considered unfavorable, warning of **damage to one’s name**. Caution in conduct and associations is advised under this face, as things can easily turn against one’s image.
- **Pisces (0°–30°)** – _Sign ruler: Jupiter_.
    
    - **1st Decan (0–10° Pisces)** – **Ruler:** Saturn. **Iconography:** (Text: “a man with two bodies pointing fingers” – possibly incomplete)​

        . We have an explanatory line: “This is the phase of Saturn. It demonstrates **little force in attack, weakness, long travels, suffering, exhaustion, and quest for livelihood**.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=,%C2%ABThe%20image%20of%20an%20evil)
        
        **Attributes:** A weary journeyer. **Shadow:** vulnerability, chronic fatigue, wandering without stability, poverty (all classic Saturnine burdens). **Light:** spiritual resilience, compassion born of suffering, and a penchant for pilgrimage (literal or figurative). The two-bodied image may symbolize a person carrying their past self or another’s burden. This decan often points to a life of lessons through loss, ultimately leading to surrender of ego (a necessary step for Pisces’ enlightenment).
    - **2nd Decan (10–20° Pisces)** – **Ruler:** Jupiter. **Iconography:** An upside-down man holding food​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%201st%20decan%20Pisces%2C%20and,desire%20and%20a%20tendency%20to)
        
        . **Attributes:** Surprisingly positive: “It indicates **dignity, inspiration, and capability in handling great matters**.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=PICATRIX%201st%20decan%20Pisces%2C%20and,desire%20and%20a%20tendency%20to)
        
        **Light:** honor, spiritual insight (inspiration), and competence in important affairs – a mix of Jupiterian wisdom and Piscean intuitive depth. The upside-down posture suggests unconventional perspective or sacrifice, yet the result is enlightened understanding. **Shadow:** perhaps martyrdom or idealism that isolates one (the inversion might imply feeling out of place). But overall, this is a favorable face for **visionary leadership and selfless service**, often producing inspired problem-solvers or compassionate influencers.
    - **3rd Decan (20–30° Pisces)** – **Ruler:** Mars. **Iconography:** An “evil man” with a woman, above whom is a donkey, and she holds a bird – a strange scene​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=a%20phase%20of%20Jupiter,SCHIFANOIA%20As%20can%20be%20seen)
        
        . The text clarifies: “It indicates **marital sexual relations, hugging, lust, intimacy, sensuous desire and a tendency for leisure and relaxation**.”​
        
        [slideshare.net](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/picatrix-and-the-decans-of-the-salone-dei-mesi/29604568#:~:text=tiring%2C%20looking%20for%20wealth%20and,2nd%20decan%20PISCES%203rd%20decan)
        
        **Attributes:** This is the erotic and hedonistic side of Pisces. **Light side:** deep intimacy, **emotional fulfillment**, artistic sensuality, and a healthy appreciation of rest/pleasure. **Shadow side:** indulgence in lust and laziness – escaping reality through sex or luxury. Mars’s passion in Pisces’ ocean can manifest as **overwhelming sensuality**. If balanced, it yields profound emotional bonding and creative fertility (many artists have strong Pisces influences here); if unbalanced, it can lead to escapism in fantasies and addictions to pleasure.

As seen, **each decan functions as a micro-zodiac**, blending the sign’s core nature with a planetary sub-ruler and a rich symbolic narrative. The “light” qualities often align with the planet’s positive expression in that sign, while the “shadow” reflects either the planet’s difficult side or the excess of the sign’s traits. Hermetic astrologers and mages used this system to fine-tune interpretations and create talismans: for example, a talisman made in the first decan of Aries (under Mars) would invoke bold martial energy for victory​

, whereas one made in the third decan of Pisces (under Mars in a water sign) might be geared toward love and sensual pleasure. The _systemic structure_ underlying the decans is thus one of **correspondence and resonance**: 36 decans = 12 signs × 3, mapping also to the 7 classical planets cycling in a meaningful order. This allowed occultists to integrate decans with other systems (e.g. 36 corresponding talismanic spirits, the 36 **Egyptian decan gods** as mentioned by Hermetic writers, or even the 36 **cards of the minor arcana** in tarot minus the Aces as done by Golden Dawn)​

. In sum, the decans provide a **structured esoteric framework** in which astrology, mythology, and magic converge – each decan is a structural unit with defined rulerships and qualities, maintaining theoretical coherence across sources like _Picatrix_ and Agrippa (who largely preserve the same images and meanings​

), even as different traditions emphasize different mythic associations. This ensured that the mathematical division of the sky into 36 parts remained **laden with symbolic depth** and ready for practical use in astrological magic, where knowing the precise nature of each decan was crucial for timing rituals and crafting images in line with the cosmos​

Key Observations
    1. Material Sympathies:
        ◦ Metals/stones align with planetary rulers (e.g., iron for Mars, silver for Moon).
        ◦ Plants often reflect decan’s elemental nature (e.g., fiery nettle for Sekhmet, watery lotus for Isis).
    2. Meditative Archetypes:
        ◦ Egyptian deities merge with Hellenistic astral spirits (e.g., Sopdet/Sirius as dog-star woman).
        ◦ Hybrid figures (lionesses transforming into cats, wolf-headed guides) reflect syncretic magic.
    3. Ritual Consistency:
        ◦ Suffumigation: Incenses match planetary/directional associations (e.g., frankincense for solar decans, myrrh for chthonic).
        ◦ Elections: Dawn/dusk timings follow Picatrix’s emphasis on solar phases harmonizing with planetary hours.
