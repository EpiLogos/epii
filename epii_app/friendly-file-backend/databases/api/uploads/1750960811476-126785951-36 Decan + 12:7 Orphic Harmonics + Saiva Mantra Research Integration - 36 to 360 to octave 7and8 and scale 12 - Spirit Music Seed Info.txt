Introduction
The 36 decans are ancient astro-magical divisions of the zodiac, each spanning 10° (roughly 10 days) and originally tied to specific stars. In ancient Egypt, decans were groups of stars used as a sidereal clock and calendar, with one decan rising each hour of the night​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Over millennia, these decans evolved from mere timekeeping markers into powerful astrological spirits or deities with distinct images and influences. They were personified in Egyptian astronomy (as on coffin lids and tomb ceilings​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
) and later absorbed into Hellenistic astrology and magic​

. Below, we undertake an extensive study of the 36 decans, beginning with their Egyptian origins and following their transformations through Greek, Indian, Arabic, and European traditions. We will explore how to create talismans for each decan using classical sources, the meditative images associated with them (and how those images changed over time), their material and symbolic correspondences, the historical contexts including periods of suppression or demonization, and the key sources and cultural transmission that preserved and revived decanic knowledge.
Talismanic Recipes & Instructions for Decans
Classical grimoires on astrological magic (especially the Picatrix) provide detailed guidance for crafting talismans for each decan. In these sources, each decan has a magical image and a set of effects or virtues that its talisman can confer. The general process of creating a decan talisman involves:
Choosing the Proper Image and Material: The Picatrix describes a specific fantastical image for each decan (see next section) and instructs the mage to form that image in a material sympathetic to the decan’s planetary ruler​

​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. For example, the first decan of Aries is ruled by Mars, so one would carve or cast its image in iron or another Martian metal, whereas a Venus-ruled decan might use copper, etc. This alignment of material (“sunthemata”) with the planet’s nature is said to greatly enhance the talisman’s potency​
ARNEMANCY.COM
.
Astrological Timing (Election): Timing is crucial. The Picatrix advises to create the image when the planetary ruler of that decan is astrologically “present” in that decan (e.g. the planet is literally in those 10° of the zodiac)​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. Ideally, you elect a moment when that planet is strong (e.g. in its hour or rising/culminating) and fortified by the Sun or other favorable aspects​
ARNEMANCY.COM
​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. For instance, a talisman of Aries’ first face (ruled by Mars) would be most “perfect” if made while Mars occupies 0–10° Aries and if possible with the Sun rising in Mars’s hour, ensuring a stable and powerful effect​
ARNEMANCY.COM
​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. This harmonizes the heavens with the talisman’s creation.
Crafting and Empowerment: At the elected time, one engraves or molds the decan’s image onto the chosen material. Classical instructions often include suffumigating the talisman with specific incenses or reciting incantations, although the Picatrix’s decan chapter focuses on the image and timing and implies that if done correctly, the talisman will “manifest in the world” the desired outcome​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. Other medieval sources add that the mage should wear or carry the finished talisman as a phylactery to continuously emit its influence​
ARNEMANCY.COM
.
Intended Effects: Each decan-talisman has particular powers. The Picatrix Book II, chapter 12 explicitly lists what each decan’s image is meant to accomplish. For example, a talisman of Aries I (0–10° Aries) grants the owner victory in battle, lawsuits and conflicts, ensuring they “gain what they wish and are never defeated,” and it can even be used to spoil milk and butter of livestock​
FORUM.BECOMEALIVINGGOD.COM
. By contrast, the talisman of Aries II (10–20° Aries, ruled by the Sun) brings “high rank, nobility, wealth and rulership”​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
 – in other words, prestige and prosperity. The Picatrix notes that many decan images have seemingly sinister or obscure uses (some faces cause illness or discord), which may explain why historically decan talismans were less commonly attempted than planetary or mansion talismans​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
. Nonetheless, a few faces were famed for their beneficial magic – e.g. the second face of Aries (a Sun face) was considered exceptionally powerful for sudden wealth and promotions, with modern practitioners reporting dramatic windfalls from its talisman​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
.
Example: To clarify the process, consider creating a talisman for Aries II (the “Second Face of Aries”). According to the Picatrix, this face ascends with the image of “a woman dressed in green clothes, lacking one leg” and is a face of nobility and wealth​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
. Its ruler is the Sun. A mage would time the crafting for when the Sun itself is in 10–20° Aries (which happens roughly March 31–April 9 each year​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
), ideally on a Sunday at sunrise. They might engrave the one-legged woman image onto a piece of gold (Sun’s metal) or yellow/golden stone, while suffumigating with solar incense. The result, if done under the right conditions, is a talisman believed to bestow honor, financial gain and leadership ability to its bearer​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
. (Medieval commentators even deduced from Picatrix that the stone for Aries II should be a yellow-green gem like peridot, matching the face’s yellow/gold color and green garments​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
.) Such detailed “recipes” exist for all 36 decans, mapping each face to specific outcomes – from love and friendship, to destruction of enemies or curing of ailments, to more peculiar aims like enclosing someone in darkness or causing discord (these more baneful uses contributed to later fears of decanic magic as “demonic”).
In summary, the classical creation of decan talismans requires careful alignment of image, material, and moment. When faithfully following the old instructions – crafting the face’s image in the corresponding planet’s metal/gem at the astrologically appropriate time – the result is a talisman said to reliably produce the decan’s promised effect “as we have said”​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. These practices, recorded in grimoires like Picatrix (and echoed by writers such as Agrippa), demonstrate the highly syncretic magic of the decans, blending Egyptian star lore, planetary correspondences, and astrological election into a single ritual act.
Meditative Images of the Decans
One of the most fascinating aspects of the decans is the rich imagery attached to each of the 36 faces. Ancient practitioners used these surreal images both for meditation/visualization and for talismanic engraving. The original forms of these images can be traced to Hellenistic and Egyptian sources, and we find remarkably consistent motifs carried through different cultures – albeit with embellishments and distortions creeping in over time as various traditions reinterpreted the decans.In the classical (Hermetic) image set—preserved in texts like the Picatrix (which itself credits “the great sages” and possibly Indian sources for these images​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
)—each decan is personified in a vivid symbolic figure. These figures often combine human and animal features or wield unusual objects, evoking the decan’s esoteric meaning. For example, the First Face of Aries was classically depicted as “a black man, large and restless, with red eyes, holding an axe and girded in a white cloth,” representing strength, high rank and unabashed wealth​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
. The Second Face of Aries, as noted, appears as a one-legged woman in green, signifying nobility and rulership​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
. The Third Face of Aries in similar sources is a man in red carrying a staff, associated with mixed luck in artistic and religious endeavors (as later Indian descriptions note)​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
. Each of the 36 decans has such a tableau – a little “scene” that encapsulates its power. These were used in meditation as a focus for the decan’s energy, and in actual talismans they would be literally carved or drawn.It is notable that multiple image lists existed. The Picatrix itself presents one set in Book II, chapter 11 (likely of Greco-Egyptian or Indian origin​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
), but later mentions another approach in chapter 12 and other sources give variant imagery. However, the core motifs tend to repeat, suggesting a common ancient origin. For instance, the first decan of Aries across sources always features a dark or black man with an axe and white garment – in the Indian tradition, Varāhamihira (6th c. India) describes “a black man wearing a white dhoti, holding an axe high” as Aries’ first drekkana​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
, clearly mirroring the Hermetic/Picatrix image​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
. Variations did occur: Varahamihira’s second Aries decan is a woman with a horse-like face, standing on one foot and very thirsty​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
, whereas the Picatrix image of Aries II doesn’t mention a horse face (later Arabic sources might have tweaked or misinterpreted certain features). Such discrepancies likely arose as the iconography was transmitted and translated (Greek to Sanskrit to Arabic to Latin), with cultural embellishments.Over time, different occult schools put their spin on the decanic images. Medieval European occultists like Agrippa reproduced the traditional images in writing, sometimes toned down or Christianized in language. Later, during the 19th–20th century occult revival, the Golden Dawn mapped the 36 decans to the 36 minor arcana cards of Tarot, which introduced entirely new pictorial associations for each decan​
ARNEMANCY.COM
​
ARNEMANCY.COM
. These modern Tarot images (e.g. the 8, 9, 10 of Pentacles corresponding to Virgo’s three decans) are quite different from the ancient faces – they focus on everyday scenarios and abstract symbolism rather than fantastical chimera-like figures. For example, the First Face of Virgo is described in the Picatrix as “a virgin covered in an old linen cloth, holding a pomegranate” (a mystical image of hidden fertility)​
ARNEMANCY.COM
, whereas its Tarot counterpart (8 of Pentacles) shows a craftsman working diligently on coins – a very mundane depiction of skill and labor. Such contrasts highlight how later cultures distorted or reinvented decan imagery to fit new paradigms (Tarot’s focus on spiritual lessons, etc.), sometimes losing the explicit astrological meaning in the process.

Comparison of classical vs. modern decan images: Top – modern collage cards for the Faces of Virgo (from J. Swofford’s Picatrix Decan deck, based on the old descriptions); Bottom – the Golden Dawn Tarot images for the corresponding decans (8, 9, 10 of Pentacles). The ancient images (top row) are allegorical figures – e.g. a veiled virgin with a pomegranate for Virgo I – while the tarot scenes (bottom) reinterpret the decan’s themes in human terms (skill, gain, legacy). Such evolution illustrates how decanic symbols were reimagined over time.​
ARNEMANCY.COM
​
ARNEMANCY.COM
Despite these later adaptations, students of astrological magic continue to meditate on the original decan images as a way to tap into the pure archetypal energy of each 10° segment. The images function as a kind of occult iconography or visual mantra. By contemplating the striking classical imagery (as bizarre as it often is – limbless figures, hybrid creatures, etc.), the practitioner moves beyond rational thought into the astral/subconscious realm that the decan spirit inhabits. In medieval grimoires and modern guides alike, it’s recommended to draw or envision the image during ritual, to “see” the decan’s power and thus invoke it. The endurance of these images – from Egyptian coffin art to Arabic manuscripts to Renaissance texts – attests to their importance in decanic magic. Even when later artists (or deck designers) altered the outer form, the inner meaning tied to each decan’s image continued to shine through, linking back to the original forms established in antiquity.
Material and Symbolic Associations
Each decan is not only an image, but an entire bundle of associations and correspondences – spanning planets, elements, materials, and abstract qualities. Ancient Hermetic and astrological texts assigned to each of the 36 decans various stones, metals, herbs, colors, animals, and other “sympathetic” items, believing these shared an occult resonance with the decan’s spirit. In the lost Hermetic treatise known as the “Sacred Book of Hermes to Asclepius”, for example, every decan had specific minerals and plants listed alongside its image, which could be used for amulets and medicines​
GRBS.LIBRARY.DUKE.EDU
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Sympatheia (mystical affinity) linked the decan’s celestial force to its terrestrial correspondences​
GRBS.LIBRARY.DUKE.EDU
. A decan ruled by Mars might be associated with iron, red coral, nettles, and sulfur, for instance, whereas a Venusian decan might relate to copper, emerald, roses, and honey – mirroring the planetary natures through the decan lens.Beyond these natural materials, decans also carry archetypal energies that manifest in various forms and symbols. The ancients connected them to the fabric of the cosmos in many ways:
Planetary and Zodiacal Links: By definition each decan is a subdivision of a zodiac sign and is also traditionally ruled by a planet (either by the Chaldean order or triplicity system​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
​
STARRYWOODSASTRO.COM
). Thus each face blends the sign’s elemental nature with the ruler’s influence. For example, the second decan of Scorpio is both a part of watery Scorpio and is ruled by the Moon (Chaldean scheme), yielding a materially associated metal of silver (lunar) and perhaps aquatic or reflective motifs. These mixtures gave each decan a unique astrological “flavor,” used in delineation and magical work. Medieval astrologers even treated the decan ruler as a minor dignity in chart interpretation (the so-called “faces” dignity​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
).
Elements, Humours, Directions: Early Hermetic correspondences tied decans to the four classical elements and humours and the four cardinal directions​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Some texts grouped the 36 faces into sets associated with winds or quarters of the compass, or classified each decan as hot/cold, wet/dry to correspond with a bodily humour (phlegmatic, choleric, etc.). This meant each decan had a role in medical astrology – certain decans could cause or cure specific diseases based on their humour affinity​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. For instance, a decan might be known to govern fevers (fire/choler) or digestive woes (earth/melancholy), and healers would time treatments or craft images accordingly​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. The decans were even mapped onto the human body: some late antique and Arabic sources associated each decan with a specific body part or organ, extending the older zodiacal man concept to finer detail (36 parts instead of 12). This way, talismans of decans were used in astrological medicine to target particular ailments​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.
Alchemical and Kabbalistic Symbolism: In the esoteric imagination, the decans’ energies also found their way into alchemical processes and mystical systems. While not explicitly in classical texts, later occultists noticed that 36 decans nicely correlate with other occult sets (for example, the 36 decan images have been likened to stages in alchemy or the 36 small deities in certain pantheons). Each decan, with its beginning, middle, end of signs, can be seen as a step in the cycle of transformation through the zodiac. Modern authors have poetically linked decans to Kabbalistic spheres or paths, though such connections are speculative. More concretely, the Golden Dawn’s linking of decans to Tarot cards created a new lattice of symbolism – each decan got a Tarot title (e.g. 5°–15° Taurus became “Lord of Success Unfulfilled”) and thus a narrative or lesson. In this way, the decanic archetype was given yet another form: the story depicted on a Tarot card.
Spiritual Beings: Just as decans correspond to planets and signs, they were also associated with intelligences or spirits. Egyptian and Graeco-Egyptian lore viewed the decans as deities or stellar demons; later, Renaissance magicians sometimes identified an angel or planetary spirit governing each face. The 16th-century mage Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, for instance, lists the faces and their images in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, and although he stops short of naming spirits for each, the implication is that each decan image “calls” a particular spiritual entity who can enact its effects. In some traditions, the decans were linked to the 72 angels of the Shemhamphorash (with two angelic names for each decan, one for day and one for night, giving a total of 72) – a synthesis of astrology with Kabbalah. Such correspondences extend the influence of decans far beyond physical materials, into the realm of divine names, sigils, and magic words that match their power.
In summary, the 36 decans form a comprehensive symbolic system. Their “archetypal energies” radiate into all levels of form: from concrete substances (metals, gems, herbs) to colors and scents, to abstract directions and elements, to mythic images and spiritual entities. For a practitioner, this means there are many avenues to work with a decan’s power: one can wear its stone, burn its incense, meditate on its image, invoke its ruling planet, recite its names – all are valid and reinforcing. This multiplicity of correspondences is what made the decans so useful in magical practice; they are like 36 keys on a cosmic keyboard, each with a unique tone that can be struck through different resonant objects and symbols. By understanding the full breadth of a decan’s associations, a magician or scholar gains a holistic perspective on that decan’s role in the cosmos, far beyond the “10 degrees of the zodiac” definition.
Historical Contexts and Suppression of the Decans
The story of the decans spans 5,000 years, moving through different cultures and sometimes going underground when condemned by religious authorities. Originally, in the Old Kingdom of Egypt (~2500 BCE), decans were purely astronomical, but even then they likely had a cultic aspect – Egyptians personified many stars as gods. Over time the decans became seen as powerful divinities or demons that could influence human destiny​
QSPACE.LIBRARY.QUEENSU.CA
. By the late Pharaonic period, each decan had names and was depicted as a deity with specific iconography on tomb ceilings (e.g. in the Tomb of Senenmut) and in the Cairo Calendar papyrus. This Egyptian belief held that the decan spirits could bring about events (plagues, prosperity, etc.), so rituals evolved to propitiate or harness them.When Hellenistic astrology rose in Alexandria (c. 2nd–1st century BCE), Greek astrologers adopted the decans into their system​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. They integrated the decans with the 12 signs and 7 planets, assigning planetary rulers to decans and using them for finer delineation. Alongside this, a strain of Hermetic magic (Greco-Egyptian occultism) treated the decans as 36 theurgic entities. The Graeco-Egyptian Magical Papyri include spells that invoke strange deity names which some scholars think correspond to decan gods. At the same time, texts like the Testament of Solomon (circa 1st–3rd century CE) took a very different view: in this pseudepigraphal Christian-influenced text, the decans appear as 36 demons bound and questioned by King Solomon. Each decan demon (often given a corrupted Egyptian name) claims to cause a specific disease or misfortune (e.g. headaches, throat pain, accidents)​
THE-DEMONIC-PARADISE.FANDOM.COM
​
THE-DEMONIC-PARADISE.FANDOM.COM
. Solomon, by divine authority, compels them to give healing formulas (usually invoking an angel to thwart them)​
THE-DEMONIC-PARADISE.FANDOM.COM
. This reflects an early demonization of the decans – literally casting the former star-gods as infirmity-causing devils to be exorcised by monotheistic power. The socio-religious reason for this was clear: as Christianity spread, any pagan star-deity had to be either denounced as a demon or absorbed into angelology. The decans, with their exotic names and images, could not be Christianized, so demonology was their fate in texts like these.During the Byzantine and early Islamic era, open worship or invocation of decans was further suppressed. The Eastern Roman Empire, being Christian, preserved some astrological knowledge (e.g. the writer Cosmas of Maiuma in the 6th century listed decan names​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
), but such knowledge was often tucked away in encyclopedias or compendia, not celebrated. The rise of Islam in the 7th century likewise frowned on astrological idols – the Quran and Hadith strongly condemn star-worship and image-making. However, rather than eliminate astrological lore, Islamic scholars translated and philosophized it. In scholarly settings (like the great library of Baghdad), Persian and Arab astronomers studied Hellenistic astrology including decans, but they framed it more scientifically. The astrological images of the decans were often omitted or euphemized in Islamic texts due to the prohibition on figurative talismans (indeed, some Islamic jurists deemed image-magic to be a form of sorcery or idolatry). This led to a curious situation: works like the Picatrix (originally Arabic, 10th century) included the decan images and talisman instructions, but likely circulated in secret or under patronage of more heterodox courts (such as in Andalusian Spain or among Harranian star-worshippers). In more orthodox contexts, the decans might simply be mentioned as subdivisions or left out entirely to avoid religious censure.In medieval Europe, knowledge of the decans came via translations of Arabic works. By the 12th–13th centuries, texts like Albertus Magnus’s writings and the Speculum Astronomiae discuss astrological images – often to condemn them as demonic. The Church’s stance was that using images to compel celestial spirits bordered on devil invocation. Indeed, in 1310 Pope Clement V formally banned talismans and images of the stars as demonic devices. The decans, with their sometimes monstrous images (half-animal people, etc.), were easy targets for accusations of trafficking with demons. This forced occult astrologers to be cautious; some manuscripts of Picatrix and similar grimoires circulated only in occult circles. A telling example: Marcilio Ficino, a Renaissance Platonist, carefully sanitized astrological magic by focusing on natural correspondences (music, herbs) rather than carved images, to avoid charges of demonolatry – a sign of how sullied the practice of decan-image magic had become.Yet, the decans were never completely forgotten. During the Renaissance, there was a resurgence of interest in all things Hermetic and astrological, spurred by the influx of Greek manuscripts and translations of Arabic magical texts. Occult philosophers like Agrippa (1486–1535) included the decan descriptions in his comprehensive Occult Philosophy, effectively reintroducing them to learned Europeans​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. While Agrippa presented them as part of God’s creation (thus trying to legitimize them), others like Giordano Bruno and Tommaso Campanella openly speculated on using astral images for influence, facing imprisonment or worse for such ideas. The tug-of-war with suppression continued. By the 17th century, as rationalism grew, belief in astrological decans waned publicly, and any remaining practice went underground into secret societies or folk astrology.The decans saw a real rediscovery and rehabilitation starting in the 19th century. Two parallel movements caused this: the academic rediscovery of ancient Egyptian and Hermetic lore, and the occult revival. Scholars like Champollion and later Egyptologists deciphered hieroglyphs and found references to decans on temple ceilings and papyri, confirming their antiquity and usage. For instance, French astronomer Jean Baptiste Biot in the 1800s researched the Egyptian decanal stars. At the same time, French occultist Eliphas Lévi and the English Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were mining Renaissance sources (like Agrippa and medieval grimoires) for forgotten wisdom – and thus re-encountered the decans. The Golden Dawn integrated decans into their system (via Tarot and Kabbalah), rebranding them as facets of the zodiac with spiritual significance, rather than “evil demons.” This was essentially the start of a decan resurgence in magical practice.In the 20th and 21st centuries, the trend accelerated. New translations of key texts – e.g. David Pingree’s scholarly work on Yavanajataka and Picatrix, and the English translation of Picatrix by Greer & Warnock (2000s) – made decanic lore more accessible. Modern astrologers like Austin Coppock (author of 36 Faces) have worked to synthesize the various traditions, giving the decans fresh descriptive names and encouraging practitioners to engage with them meditatively and magically. What was once feared as a demonic art has been reframed as a valid part of astrological magic and self-exploration. In recent decades, creating decan talismans has actually grown in popularity among occultists (though still a niche practice), and the imagery is seeing new life in art – from oracle card decks depicting the decan figures to digital art inspired by Picatrix descriptions. The decans have thus come full circle: from sacred stars in Egypt, to forbidden demonic forces in medieval times, to objects of fascination and revival today.
Sources & Cultural Evolution of Decanic Lore
Tracking the decans through history requires piecing together many texts and artifacts. Key sources that preserved decanic knowledge include:
Ancient Egyptian Texts: The earliest records are the Diagonal Star Tables on Middle Kingdom coffin lids and the astronomical ceilings of New Kingdom tombs​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. These list decan star names (like Sepdet for Sirius and others) and sometimes depict the decan deities. Later Egyptian calendars (e.g. the Cairo Calendar) and Demotic magical papyri include decan references, showing their integration into omenology and magic. However, much of this was lost until modern Egyptology rediscovered it.
Hermetic and Greco-Roman Works: In Hellenistic Egypt, the Hermetic tradition recorded decan lore in texts like the “Book of Hermes to Asclepius” (also called the Sacred Book of Hermes). This work (preserved in fragments and later summaries) gave a full account of decans with images, names, stones, plants, etc., and was a cornerstone for later magic​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
​
GRBS.LIBRARY.DUKE.EDU
. Fragments of Hermetic decan teachings are quoted by authors such as Teucer of Babylon (a 1st c. BCE astrologer who catalogued decan effects), Julius Firmicus Maternus (4th c. who gave the Latin names of decans and their effects), and Porphyry or Iamblichus (Neoplatonists who mention decans in cosmic hierarchy). The Gnostic and astrological mystics also dealt with decans – e.g., the Gnostic text Pistis Sophia lists decan-like demon rulers, and the neoplatonic philosopher Proclus discussed decans as cosmic forces. The Testament of Solomon (c. 3rd c. CE) preserved decan names in a Christianized context of demons. All these were later mined by scholars like Wilhelm Gundel, who in 1936 compiled a landmark study on decans (cited by modern sources)​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.
Indian Astrology Texts: Knowledge of decans (“drekkana”) traveled east to India, likely via Greek influences. The Yavanajātaka (“Nativity of the Yavanas”, 3rd c. CE) is a Sanskrit text that translated Greek astrology for an Indian audience​
LAURABARATASTROLOGER.COM
. It included descriptions of the 36 drekkana images (very close to the Hellenistic ones). Later, the famous Indian astrologer Varāhamihira (6th c.) in his Brihat Jataka and Brhat Samhita gave detailed drekkana imagery and uses​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
​
VARAHAMIHIRA.BLOGSPOT.COM
, ensuring this knowledge survived in the East. These works remained part of the Indian tradition and were never demonized there; they simply became one layer of India’s complex astrological system. Through colonial-era translations in the 19th century, Western scholars like David Pingree studied these to understand the Greek-Egyptian origin of the images​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.
Arabic and Persian Works: In the Islamic world, the decans feature in astrological manuals though often without images. Abū Maʿshar (Albumasar, 9th c.) in his Great Introduction lists decan rulers and effects, and Al-Qazwini (13th c.) mentions decans in cosmology. The pinnacle is the Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm (Picatrix), compiled c. 10th century in Arabic, which preserved almost verbatim the full set of decan images and their talismanic instructions from late antiquity​
FORUM.BECOMEALIVINGGOD.COM
​
FORUM.BECOMEALIVINGGOD.COM
. This text acted as a repository of Hermetic magic (including Indian and Sabian influences) and was crucial in transmitting decanic magic to Europe when translated to Spanish and Latin in the 13th century. Another example is Ibn Ezra (12th c. Jewish scholar) who in his astrological texts included knowledge of decans (likely from Arabic sources) and helped pass it to medieval Jewish and Christian readers.
Medieval and Renaissance Latin Texts: Once in Latin (with the Picatrix translation ~1256 for King Alfonso X), the decan lore seeped into various works. The Liber Hermetis (a Latin compendium of Hermetic astrology) contained decan material. Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus were aware of astrological images (often to caution against them). The most influential renaissance compilation, as mentioned, was Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia (1533) – he lists each decan’s image and its attributed meaning almost exactly as in Picatrix​
FORUM.BECOMEALIVINGGOD.COM
. This book circulated widely in occult circles (despite being put on the Church’s Index). Later occult authors like Francis Barrett (The Magus, 1801) reproduced Agrippa’s content, keeping decan lore alive. Meanwhile, scholars like Scaliger (16th c.) and Athanasius Kircher (17th c.) studied ancient sources: Scaliger tried to reconcile decan lists from different cultures​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
, and Kircher in Oedipus Aegyptiacus gathered whatever he could on Egyptian decans (including Coptic names and drawings)​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
, though often misinterpreting them through a Christian lens. These attempts show that even in erudite circles, there was an awareness that decans were an important piece of the puzzle of ancient knowledge – albeit fragmentary.
Modern Rediscovery: In the late 19th and 20th centuries, academic works by historians of astrology like Franz Cumont, Wilhelm Gundel (author of Dekane und Dekansternbilder), and later David Pingree systematically compiled references to decans from all these sources. Their research (published in journals and books) acts as a “map” of decanic tradition for us today​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. On the occult side, contemporary authors such as Austin Coppock, T. Susan Chang, and Chris Warnock have published books specifically on decans, synthesizing historic sources and practical experience. The internet has further aided the spread: translations of primary texts and collaborative research (as seen in astrology forums and blogs) have made decans accessible to a new generation.
Thus, the cultural evolution of the decans is one of loss and recovery. Their knowledge was never in one continuous line, but rather saved in bits by different cultures – Egyptians gave the concept, Greeks gave written images and theory, Indians preserved the images through a different route, Arabs saved the magic in texts like Picatrix, and Europeans reassembled it during the Renaissance. When some pieces were lost (like the full Hermetic Asclepius text), others like Picatrix or Varahamihira filled the gap. The factors leading to rediscovery have often been cross-cultural exchange and a nostalgic interest in antiquity’s wisdom. Each era that sought to recover ancient knowledge – the Abbasid translation movement, the Renaissance humanists, the 19th-c Egyptologists, the 20th-c neopagans – found the decan stars waiting quietly, ready to reveal their secrets again. As a modern Hermetic writer elegantly put it: the 36 decans “are far beyond the planets and zodiac in power, subservient only to the Creator”​
COSMICARTIFACTS.COM
 – a grand statement echoing the Corpus Hermeticum. Whether or not one agrees with such hierarchy, it’s undeniable that the decans have cast a long shadow over astrology and magic. From temple ceilings to forbidden grimoires to tarot decks, their symbolic legacy continues to enchant and intrigue those who seek a holistic perspective on the cosmos.Sources: Classical grimoires like the Picatrix​

Intersections of Decans, Ficino’s Music, Orphic Hymns, and Saivist Vibrational Principles
This study integrates the 36 astrological decans with Marsilio Ficino’s Renaissance musical magic, the Orphic Hymns, and the vibrational principles of Śaivist mantra traditions. It maps out a musical lexicon for the decans, correlates Orphic hymns to decanic influences, draws parallels with Śaivite cosmic sound, and examines the role of sacrificial rites from ancient to modern occult contexts. The goal is to present a structured, holistic framework for modern esoteric practice, aligning cosmic sound and symbolism across cultures.

1.1 Historical Planetary Modes and Astrological Music (Ficino’s Approach)
Renaissance magus Marsilio Ficino famously used music as a form of “natural magic” to tune the soul to the heavens​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. He followed the ancient idea that each planet resonates with a particular musical mode or scale, which can induce the planet’s quality in the listener​

. Through these planetary modes, the astrological forces of the decans (which are segments of zodiac ruled by planets) could be “brought down” to earth in sound.

1.2 Decanic Harmonic Resonances – A Speculative Framework
Beyond historical sources, we can imagine a speculative harmonic framework aligning each of the 36 decans with specific tones or resonances. Since the decans are 10° segments of the zodiac each associated with a planet, one approach is to extend the planetary mode concept: assign to each decan the musical mode or scale of its ruling planet, and even a particular tone or frequency within that mode. Modern esoteric musicians have begun exploring such ideas. For example, composer Aster Graef noted a “resonance between the 36 cells of the hexadic figure and the 36 decans” – using the rising decan at a given moment to choose the initial musical interval for a composition​
LARKFALL.WORDPRESS.COM
. In one experiment, as the ascendant moved through all 36 decans over 24 hours, musical voices sequentially played through 36 corresponding tonal cells​
LARKFALL.WORDPRESS.COM
. This kind of system treats the decans as a musical calendar or zodiacal scale: as each decan rises, a new tone or chord sounds, embodying that decan’s quality in vibration.In a speculative modern lexicon, one could map all 36 decans to a cycle of musical intervals. For instance, following the traditional decan rulership sequence (Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and repeating)​
MACSPHERE.MCMASTER.CA
, we get a repeating 7-tone scale across the 36 decans. Each decan inherits the mode of its planetary ruler – e.g. a Mars-ruled decan would use the Phrygian mode, a Moon-ruled decan the Aeolian mode, etc. Further nuance could assign each decan a specific pitch class or frequency, perhaps dividing the octave or using multiple octaves to cover 36 distinct tones. The result would be a microtonal “zodiac scale” where every decan has a signature note. A modern practitioner could use this by playing the note or mode of the current decan during rituals or meditation to attune with the prevailing astrological energy. Such a framework remains speculative, but it aligns with the Pythagorean-Platonic idea that astronomy and music are intimately linked. It extends Ficino’s planetary music down to the finer granularity of decans, providing a more detailed musical vocabulary for astrological magic. In summary, the historical record gives us the planetary modes for the 7 planets, and by extension we can derive a full spectrum of 36 musical correspondences – a vibrational lexicon for each decan’s unique influence in the cosmos.
2. Orphic Hymns and Decanic Correspondences
2.1 Ficino’s Use of Orphic Hymns in Planetary Invocation
An essential part of Ficino’s astrological practice was the singing of Orphic Hymns to invoke planetary gods. The Orphic Hymns are a corpus of 87 ancient Greek hymns attributed to Orpheus, each addressed to a specific deity or cosmic force (Sun, Moon, planets, stars, etc.). Ficino considered these hymns to be magical incantations containing divine power​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. In his view, “no magic is more powerful than that of the Orphic Hymns”​
INNERTRADITIONS.COM
 – their words and melodies could draw the soul of the deity into alignment with the singer. Ficino would prepare an atmosphere for ritual: a private chamber adorned with astrological images and suffused with frankincense​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. There, “seated near a bust of Plato,” he strummed a lyre and chanted the appropriate Orphic Hymn, believing it to be authored by Orpheus himself​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. For example, under a solar decan or hour, he might sing the Hymn to Helios (Sun); for a Venusian decan, the Hymn to Aphrodite, and so on. The hymn’s ancient Greek words praised the deity’s qualities and begged their favor, serving as both prayer and spell. Accompanied by the matching planetary mode on the lyre (as discussed in §1.1), this created a full sensory invocation – sound, words, and scent – intended to attract the planet’s astral spirit. Ficino integrated these hymns into his medical astrology as well, effectively using them as therapeutic songs to rebalance a patient’s humors by planetary influence​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. For instance, a melancholic (Saturnine) patient would be sung the Orphic Hymn to Jupiter or to Venus to counter Saturn, in the joyous Lydian or gentle Ionian mode, respectively​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
.Through Ficino’s synthesis, the Orphic hymns became keyed to the decanic energies: each decan’s ruling planet or sign had a corresponding Orphic hymn for its patron deity. This was astral theurgy – using sacred song to connect with the intelligences of the cosmos. Ficino viewed it as a Christian-compatible, elevated form of magic (sometimes called natural magic), distinct from any coercive sorcery. By vocalizing these ancient hymns, he believed one could uplift the soul to commune with planetary gods or angels, thus drawing down celestial gifts. In essence, Ficino’s practice mapped the Orphic liturgy onto the decans: every decan (via its planet) had its musical prayer. His revival of Orpheus’s “sacred songs” was so influential that contemporaries dubbed Ficino the “second Orpheus”​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
​
ADRIANABARTON.COM
. This Renaissance use of Orphic hymns demonstrates how decanic astrology was married to musical and poetic invocation in a very concrete way.
2.2 Beyond Ficino: Cross-Cultural and Decanic Applications of Hymns
Ficino’s use of Orphic hymns is a particular Renaissance example of a broader phenomenon: chanting hymns to align with cosmic powers. Across cultures, we find that specific hymns, psalms, or mantras are dedicated to stellar or planetary forces, much like the Orphic verses. In the ancient Greco-Egyptian world, each of the 36 decans was personified as a god or spirit, and likely invoked with prayers or offerings. The Egyptians originally defined the decans as star-gods (“the starry deities”) used to tell time at night​
YOUREGYPTTOURS.COM
​
YOUREGYPTTOURS.COM
. “Each decan was named and associated with a corresponding god or goddess,” and images of these decan gods were painted on tombs and inscribed on amulets​
YOUREGYPTTOURS.COM
. In later Hellenistic magic (e.g. the Greek Magical Papyri and texts like Picatrix), spells often included hymnic invocations to the decans or their planetary lords, sometimes in voces mysticae (mystical syllables) resembling mantras. This suggests a continuity: calling on cosmic deities through sacred words was seen as key to decanic magic. The Orphic Hymns themselves, composed in Asia Minor around the 2nd century CE, were possibly used in the theurgic rites of the Neoplatonists. Proclus and others commented on Orphic verses as containing the secret names of gods, useful for summoning divine presence.Cross-cultural parallels abound. In Vedic India, for example, the planets (Grahas) had hymns in the Vedas and later Navagraha mantras for propitiation – akin to Orphic hymns for the planets. A devotee concerned about a malefic Mars would chant the Mangala mantra, just as a Platonist might sing the Orphic Hymn to Ares for Mars. Even the structure of a hymn cycle covering all aspects of life has parallels: the Orphic Hymns as a whole have been called a “book of hours or a calendar of life, addressing every event from birth to death”​
INNERTRADITIONS.COM
. This mirrors how the 36 decans span the entire zodiacal circle (360°) and thus the full cycle of the year’s experiences. We can thus align the Orphic Hymns with decanic principles: each hymn’s deity embodies certain cosmic functions that correspond to zodiac segments. For instance, the Orphic Hymn to Zeus (Jupiter) praises the god of thunder, wealth, and kings – concepts resonant with the Jupiter-ruled decans (which astrology associates with expansion, fortune, authority). The Hymn to Selene (Moon) lauds the lunar queen, matching the Moon-ruled decans known for changeability, fertility, and the subconscious.Beyond the Greco-Roman sphere, many cultures developed hymnody to cosmological forces, effectively creating analogues to Orphic hymns. The Hermetic tradition had hymns to planets (the Psalms of Saturn, etc.). In Sumerian/Babylonian religion, each planet-god (Ishtar=Venus, Shamash=Sun, etc.) had temple hymns and prayers used in celestial magic. Thus, while Ficino’s specific practice was to use the Orphic texts, the underlying principle – singing invocations to cosmic intelligences – is universal in esoteric traditions. It serves as a bridge between the human and the divine realms of the decans. Modern esoteric practitioners have reawakened interest in the Orphic Hymns (new translations and recordings exist) not only for historical curiosity but as living ritual tools. They are used in contemporary astrology circles for planet meditations, often synchronized with zodiacal timings (for example, chanting the Hymn to Phusis [Nature] at the spring equinox, or the Hymn to Saturn during a Saturn transit). Such practices show the enduring power of “attuning to the sacred presence” through hymnody​
INNERTRADITIONS.COM
. In a cross-cultural modern framework, one might incorporate Orphic hymns alongside other traditions’ sacred songs (Gregorian chants, Vedic mantras, etc.) to honor the decans. The key is that voice and word – the vibrational utterance of mythic poetry – becomes a sacrament linking microcosm and macrocosm. The Orphic hymns provide a Western esoteric lexicon of sound correspondences for the decans, much as mantras do in the East, as we explore next.
3. Śaivist Mantras and Decanic Resonances
3.1 Tonal, Vibrational and Harmonic Commonalities
In the Śaivite traditions of India (particularly Kashmir Śaivism and Shaiva Tantra), sound and vibration are seen as the fundamental creative forces of the universe – an outlook remarkably consonant with Ficino’s musical astro-magic. Śaivite cosmology holds that the cosmos is composed of 36 tattvas (principles or levels of reality) from the gross elements up to the ultimate Śiva tattva. Crucially, these tattvas are understood to have corresponding mantras or sonic essences. In Abhinavagupta’s Kashmir Śaivism, “the cosmos comprises mantra and tattva which are the signifier and signified, in so far as mantra is the sound expression of a level of the cosmos…These levels of the cosmos correspond to mantras…a rich equation can therefore be made between tattva, mantra and devatā.”​
KB.OSU.EDU
. In other words, each ontological level (tattva) of reality has its vibrational sound-form (mantra) and its presiding deity. “The mantra is the body of the deity and also a level of the cosmos equated with [a] tattva”​
KB.OSU.EDU
. There are 36 such levels, each ultimately linked to a Sanskrit phoneme or mantra, reflecting the view that all creation is sonic in essence. The parallels to the 36 decans are striking: just as each decan is a segment of the zodiac ruled by a planet/deity, each tattva is a segment of reality “ruled” by a deity and embodied by a sound vibration. Both systems enumerate 36 divisions as the architecture of the cosmos – one spatial (zodiacal segments) and one ontological – and both ascribe a guiding intelligence or force to each division.The vibrational principles at play show commonality. Ficino spoke of the “music of the spheres” and how earthly music can resonate sympathetically with the heavens​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
. Śaivism speaks of Nāda-Brahman (the ultimate reality as sound) and Śabda, the cosmic Sound/Word that manifests as creation. The Spanda doctrine in Kashmir Shaivism literally means “vibration” – the subtle throb through which Śiva’s consciousness unfolds the universe. Mantras are seen as packets of this cosmic vibration; by reciting them, one aligns one’s individual vibration with that of the deity or cosmic function invoked. This is analogous to Ficino’s idea of singing a specific melody to synchronize with a planet’s energy. Both frameworks assert that sound has direct causal efficacy on different levels of being: healing the body-mind, purifying the soul, attracting divine influence. Modern science aside, in metaphysical terms both agree that vibration underlies manifestation. A tonal analysis shows that Gregorian modes and Sanskrit mantras, despite cultural differences, operate on the premise of specific frequency patterns affecting consciousness. For instance, the droning of “Om̐” in a deep tone creates a meditative, Saturn-like atmosphere (centering, contracting awareness), while a high lilting chant to Lalita (goddess of Venusian qualities) creates an expansive, heart-opening vibe – much as a Lydian mode hymn to Venus might in Ficino’s system.Indeed, certain harmonic concepts appear in both East and West: the interval of a fifth is considered stabilizing (in Pythagorean music theory and Indian classical music as well), whereas a minor third or other dissonance can induce sorrow or tension. These could be correlated to planetary emotions – for example, Indian rāgas associated with dawn or dusk might be likened to certain decans associated with those times of year. While Ficino did not know of Indian mantras, his Neoplatonic worldview would concur that all traditions point to a universal harmonic truth. By studying Śaivist mantra practice, one finds independent confirmation of the idea that sound = power and that different sounds correspond to different cosmic hierarchies (planets, tattvas, chakras, etc.). Both traditions encourage the practitioner to use sound as a means of inner alchemy – transforming one’s state to resonate with higher states (deities, planets, divine principles).
3.2 Cosmic Sound and Celestial Order – Bridging Traditions
The convergence of Ficino’s astral music, Orphic hymns, and Śaivist mantras can be understood through the concept of cosmic sound ordering the universe. In Śaivism, the primordial sound Oṁ (aum) is the sonic seed from which creation unfolds – it contains within it all vibrations, much like white light contains the spectrum of colors. This parallels the Western Hermetic notion of the Logos or the “Word” through which God created the heavens and the earth (as in the Gospel of John). The music of the spheres in Plato’s and Ficino’s philosophy is essentially this concept: the planets and stars produce a divine harmony (inaudible to physical ears but perceptible to the soul) that maintains cosmic order​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
. The role of the mage or mystic is to intentionally harmonize with this cosmic music. Mantra-yoga in Śaivism serves exactly that purpose – through repeated intonation of a mantra, one’s consciousness attunes to the deity which that mantra embodies, ultimately merging into higher consciousness (Śiva). Likewise, Ficino’s theurgic singing was meant to attune the human psyche to the planetary spirit and ultimately to the One (God). In both cases, imagination and intent guide sound: Ficino spoke of “symbolic perception” and the need to engage the imagination to make the correspondence effective​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
, and in Tantra the bhāva (feeling/visualization) while chanting is said to vitalize the mantra.Bridging these traditions, one can see a unified practice emerging for a modern esoteric framework: use sound as the bridging medium between microcosm and macrocosm. A practitioner might combine Gregorian planetary chants or Orphic hymns with Sanskrit mantras in a single ritual context. For example, to work with a Mercury-ruled decan, one could intone the Orphic Hymn to Hermes and also chant “Om Budhāya Namaha” (a Vedic Mercury mantra), perhaps even alternating or overlaying them with a musical drone in Mercury’s Locrian mode. The cross-resonance could be profound – both East and West methods reinforcing the mercurial, quicksilver mental energy. Similarly, for a Saturn decan, one could perform Ficino’s Saturn hymn (or Psalm) in Mixolydian mode and include the mantra “Om Namah Shivaya” (as Śiva is often associated with time, death, and thus Saturnine qualities in some esoteric correlations). The metaphysical rationale is that truth is one: Saturn or Śani or Chronos – different names, same archetype – and sound is the universal language to interact with that archetype.There are also philosophical bridges: Kashmir Śaivism’s doctrine that “the mantra is the body of the deity”​
KB.OSU.EDU
 rhymes with the Hermetic axiom that symbols (here sound symbols) embody spiritual realities. The 36 decans and 36 mantric tattvas both suggest that the entire cosmos can be mapped and engaged through a finite set of sacred sounds or hymns. This invites a holistic synthesis: one could create a correspondence table listing each decan with (1) its astrological significations, (2) a musical mode/note, (3) an Orphic hymn or Western sacred chant, and (4) a Śaivite or other mantra, plus (5) an emblematic image or symbol. By working with all correspondences together, the practitioner leverages multiple levels of resonance – musical, verbal, conceptual – to fully invoke or meditate on that decan’s principle. Such a practice respects the “perennial philosophy” idea that different cultures’ esoteric systems are complementary, not contradictory. The vibrational harmony sought by Ficino and by Śaivite sages alike can be experienced more powerfully when these streams converge. In sum, Śaivist mantra traditions affirm and enrich the decanic practices by providing a refined understanding of how sound = sacred power, encouraging modern practitioners to treat their Orphic or planetary chants truly as mantras – mystic formulas that, when repeated with devotion, unlock the doors of the cosmos.
4. Sacrificial Rites in Decanic and Elite Occult Practices
4.1 Blood and Offerings: Sacrifice in Decanic Magic Through History
The theme of sacrifice has long accompanied decanic and astrological magic, though its form and perceived necessity have varied greatly by culture. In the oldest strata of decanic lore – ancient Egypt – the decans were celestial gods, and Egyptians regularly made offerings to their gods to maintain maat (cosmic order). While specific records of Egyptian decan rituals are sparse, we know that in Egyptian temples the rising of certain stars (decans) were celebrated with hymns and offerings of incense, libations, and food, as part of the cult of the stars. As decanic astrology spread through the Greco-Egyptian world, references to more dramatic sacrifices emerge. The Hermetic texts and Greek Magical Papyri (PGM) include spells to decan spirits that sometimes prescribe the sacrifice of animals or the use of animal parts (blood, entrails) as ritual components to attract or compel the celestial daimon. The logic was sympathetic magic: to draw down a strong influence from, say, a Mars decan, one might offer a red rooster or ram (creatures sacred to Mars/Ares) as a pleasing gift or as a transfer of life-force.By the time of the medieval Arabic grimoire Picatrix (11th century), which compiled much earlier Sabian and Harranian astrological magic, sacrifice was often quite literal. The Picatrix gives detailed talismanic operations for each decan or planet, many of which involve animal sacrifice. For example, a ritual for Saturn (ruler of certain decans) says to “behead a black goat, and collect and save its blood; extract its liver and burn [it] to ashes… When you have done this, what you desire will come”​
KRASIANCIENTASTROLOGY.COM
. In another case, Picatrix describes a Martian ritual in which originally a human victim (a young boy dressed as the god of Mars) was to be sacrificed, but the compiler notes that in later practice “the human sacrifice was replaced by an animal one”​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
 – for instance, using a rooster or ram as a substitute for the boy to satisfy the spirit of Mars​
MDPI.COM
. This substitution may have been influenced by ethical or religious shifts (the text even alludes to the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac as a precedent for replacing a child with a ram​
MDPI.COM
). In these pre-modern contexts, practitioners firmly believed that sacrificing a living being released a potent energy that empowered the ritual and bound the astral spirit to the magician’s will. Blood was considered a food or currency for spirits. In polytheistic and animist cultures, such sacrifices were a traditional form of piety (e.g. sacrificing a bull to Jupiter or a goat to Pan was standard practice). Thus, in certain cultural contexts – especially those with necromantic or coercive aims – sacrifice was deemed not only acceptable but necessary to achieve results in decanic magic. The willingness to kill an animal (or risk the taboo of blood) was seen as a measure of one’s commitment and a direct way to engage with the raw forces of life and death that these star-spirits controlled.However, attitudes toward sacrifice varied. Even in antiquity, philosophical magi (the Theurgists of late antiquity, for example) distinguished between higher sacrifices (incense, cakes, prayers) for heavenly gods and lower sacrifices (blood offerings) for chthonic or daemonic entities. The Neoplatonist Iamblichus defended the necessity of material offerings in theurgy but emphasized that the purest rites use symbolic substitutes to avoid impure acts. This debate carried into the medieval period: Islamic and Christian sensibilities were often offended by the Picatrix’s prescriptions. We see evidence of adaptation – as mentioned, Picatrix’s Latin translators toned down some of the human sacrifice elements​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. By the Renaissance, the very notion of sacrificing animals in magic had become associated with black magic or satanic witchcraft in the European mindset, something “civilized” magicians would generally abhor (at least publicly).
4.2 Renaissance Refinement: From Sacrifice to Symbolic Offerings
Renaissance Hermeticists and natural magicians like Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Johannes Trithemius, and later Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa sought to reform astrological magic’s image. They reinterpreted or discarded the crude sacrificial aspects inherited from texts like Picatrix, aiming to align the practice with Christian theology and Neoplatonic ethics. Ficino, as a priest, explicitly distanced himself from any literal sacrifices. Instead, he offered a bloodless sacrifice of music, prayer and contemplation. In his work Three Books on Life, Ficino outlines rituals for drawing down planetary influences that involve suffumigations (perfumes for each planet), light (planetary colored candles), and Orphic hymn singing, but no animal harm. He believed that the pure intentions of the mage and the elevated nature of the Orphic songs were sufficient to entice the celestial spirits – essentially replacing the pagan animal sacrifice with an intellectual and spiritual offering of praise. This follows a general Renaissance trend: sublimation of sacrifice into allegory. For example, an image or talisman could symbolically “contain” the life force that would earlier have been obtained via sacrifice. Agrippa in De Occulta Philosophia (1533) lists the images and correspondences of decans and planets, but when it comes to actual practice, he advises prayer to God and the use of natural sympathies (herbs, stones, etc.) rather than blood rites.Renaissance magi framed their work as natural magic (manipulating hidden properties placed in creation by God) as opposed to demonic magic. They were keen to avoid the charge of necromancy, which in the Renaissance specifically implied trafficking with demons often via horrific sacrifices. One can see this intellectualization as an attempt to reclaim decanic magic from the “sacrificial cults” of earlier eras and make it acceptable to the cultural elite. They stressed that the true sacrifice was devotion or the magus’s own spirit. For instance, the sacrifice of a bull to Jupiter could be transformed into burning a bull-shaped wax candle with Jupiterian incense, accompanied by a pious hymn – achieving a similar symbolic effect. Marsilio Ficino and successors like Giordano Bruno or Tommaso Campanella even described magical ritual in terms of internal sacrifice: the practitioner offers up his lower passions, or “sacrifices” personal vices, in order to achieve union with the stars or divine forms. Thus the entire notion of sacrifice was philosophically elevated: from an outer literal act to an inner mystical act.This is not to say that all Renaissance-era occultists shunned literal sacrifice – folk magic and some grimoires continued to quietly prescribe animal parts (e.g. the Key of Solomon has ingredients like dove blood). But among the learned magi, there was a definite effort to sanitize astral magic. Even when these magicians did engage in rituals considered illicit, they cloaked them in Neoplatonic platitudes. John Dee, for example, working a century after Ficino, was horrified at any suggestion of sacrifice and insisted his angelic communications were achieved through pure prayer and skrying, not invocations with offerings. The trend was clear: to practice decanic/planetary magic as an “elite” pursuit, one had to repudiate the crude sacrifices of the past. This intellectualization aligned with the broader Renaissance impulse to integrate magic with morality and reason. Magic was to be done with the mind and spirit, not with dagger and blood.
4.3 Modern Perspectives: Sacrificial Residues and Conspiracy Theories
In the modern era, overt ritual sacrifice is largely absent from mainstream esoteric practice – both because of ethical evolution and the influence of monotheistic values. Instead, contemporary occultists use symbolic sacrifices: e.g. writing one’s negative trait on paper and burning it, or offering fruits and flowers on an altar, or fasting (self-sacrifice) as part of a working. The literal spilling of blood is rare and generally frowned upon in serious circles (with some fringe exceptions discussed below). However, the idea of sacrifice retains a powerful hold on the imagination, and some claim it persists in secret among the powerful. Conspiracy theories and fringe perspectives often allege that “elite occultists” continue to practice hidden forms of sacrifice. For instance, the secretive Bohemian Grove gathering of political and business elites became the focus of such theories in the 2000s. During the club’s Cremation of Care ceremony – a theatrical burning of an effigy – conspiracy commentator Alex Jones claimed he had witnessed a human “ritual sacrifice” (though in reality it was a dummy burned as a symbolic gesture)​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. He and others suggested that the world’s elites were reenacting pagan sacrificial rituals in private, fueling the narrative of a “Satanic shadowy elite”​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. In 2019, photographer Jack Latham investigated these claims and noted, “the infamous right-wing commentator [Jones] claims to this day that the Bohemian Grove hosts occult practices and human sacrifice,” even though evidence points more to an “overgrown frat party” with symbolic pageantry​
FEATURESHOOT.COM
. This illustrates how the notion of sacrifice in elite practice survives as myth or accusation, regardless of factual basis.Another modern manifestation was the late-20th-century “Satanic Panic,” where rumors spread of global Satanic cults (often supposedly involving the wealthy and powerful) abducting and ritually sacrificing children. “Some allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and elite in which children are abducted, abused, and sacrificed,” according to sociological summaries of that panic​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. While exhaustive investigations debunked most of these claims as baseless, they left a cultural residue – the fear that vestiges of ancient sacrificial cults might still lurk in modern power structures. Occult scholars note that real instances of ritualistic murder are extremely rare and usually isolated (often perpetrated by disturbed individuals or small extremist groups, not organized secret societies). Yet the symbolism of sacrifice endures. For example, certain neo-pagan or Thelemic groups might symbolically reenact sacrifices (using effigies or blood substitutes) to tap into archetypal energies. The Order of Nine Angles, a far-right occult group, infamously advocated (in writings, at least) for “culling” human victims as a form of satanic practice – a truly fringe position that has gotten members in trouble with the law. These cases are outliers; they are not representative of any “elite” occult mainstream, but they show how the dark allure of sacrifice still emerges in fringe occult ideology.On the flip side, modern magicians who follow paths like Wicca, Thelema, or Hermetic Golden Dawn have explicitly expunged animal sacrifice from their practices, viewing it as unnecessary and unethical. Aleister Crowley, often misquoted on this topic, did write cryptically about sacrifice (speaking of offering one’s own energies or using symbolic mediums), but in practice the major 20th-century occult orders practiced symbolic sacrifice at most. For instance, the Golden Dawn’s Neophyte ritual involves the symbolic death and rebirth of the candidate (an initiation sacrifice of the old self). In modern witchcraft, the “Great Rite” or the creation of the sacramental cakes might be seen as offering part of oneself (creative or sexual energy) to the divine, rather than killing anything. Thus, within officially promulgated modern esotericism, sacrifice has been internalized or dramatized without blood.Contemporary elite culture does have its rituals (even something like a presidential inauguration has ritual elements), but if there are “sacrificial residues,” they are heavily veiled in symbolism. An example often cited is the idea of wars or state executions as a form of collective sacrifice engineered by those in power – a metaphorical extension posited by some radical thinkers, though that veers into sociopolitical theory more than occultism. More concretely, groups like the Freemasons or Rosicrucians, which some consider “elite occult” networks, do not engage in sacrifice in their rites; their rituals are allegorical dramas of moral lessons (despite what some conspiracy theorists suspect).In summary, the historical arc has moved from literal, often gruesome sacrifices in antiquity’s decanic magic to the “sacrifice of sacrifice” in the Renaissance (sacrificing the practice itself in favor of higher means), to a modern scene where sacrifice survives mostly as symbol or specter. Modern esoteric practitioners, informed by both humanitarian values and the comparative study of traditions, generally choose to offer something meaningful yet non-harmful in their workings – be it a libation of wine, a piece of one’s hair, a prayer, or the creative output of a song or artwork dedicated to the intent. The consensus is that the cosmos can be moved by empathy and will more than by spilling blood. The lingering fascination or paranoia about secret sacrifices among the elite likely says more about enduring archetypal fears (and the human psyche’s dark corners) than about actual widespread practice. Nonetheless, any holistic framework for modern esoteric practice must be aware of these historical shadows. In building a positive, ethical practice, one consciously replaces the need for sacrificial “fuel” with personal devotion, discipline, and resonance – harnessing the same energies through love and knowledge rather than through violence or coercion.
5. Integrative Framework and Correspondence Map
Bringing together all the above elements, we can outline a structured framework for modern esoteric practice centered on the 36 decans and their cross-traditional correspondences. Each decan can be seen as a portal to specific cosmic energies, accessible through multiple modalities: astrology, music, hymn, mantra, and ritual. Below is a sample of how one might map a given decan across these modalities, demonstrating the integrative approach:
Decan (Sign & 0°–10° segment)	Planetary Ruler <br>(Influence)	Musical Mode <br>(Ficino/Gaffurius)	Orphic Hymn or Western Chant	Śaivite Mantra or Eastern Analog	Traditional vs. Modern Offering

(…and so on for all 36 decans, following the planetary cycle: the above five illustrate Mars, Moon, Sun, Venus, Saturn rulerships respectively. The full framework would continue mapping each decan in Aries through Pisces, cycling Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon → Saturn → Jupiter, each with corresponding modes, hymns, mantras, and offerings.)					
Using the Table: A practitioner can look up the current decan (e.g., by date or degree of the Ascendant) and find a ready set of correspondences to work with. For instance, if it is the first decan of Aries (ruled by Mars), they know to play music in Phrygian mode or a war drum rhythm, intone the Orphic Hymn to Ares or a Psalm to Saint Michael (a Mars analogy), chant the Mangala mantra, and make a symbolic offering reflecting Mars (like lighting a red candle sprinkled with a pinch of iron oxide). This multi-pronged engagement – musical, verbal, devotional, and symbolic – creates a rich resonant field aligned with that decan’s energy.By integrating Ficino’s musical-humanistic approach, Orphic/ancient hymns, and Eastern mantra-yoga, one accesses the decan’s influence on multiple levels of consciousness: the intellectual (through meaning of lyrics/intent), the emotional (through melody and rhythm), the subtle/vibrational (through mantra sound), and the material (through ritual gesture or offering). Each element reinforces the others. The ethical dimension is maintained by using only symbolic or benign offerings, transforming the older notion of sacrifice into one of personal dedication or creative act.Such a framework is holistic: it recognizes that the decans (and the cosmos at large) can be approached as divine archetypes that respond to art, music, prayer, and sound. It also embodies the Renaissance ideal of the “musica universalis” – uniting the musical, the astrological, and the spiritual into one practice​

. Meanwhile, it honors the Śaivist insight that “the combination of Śiva, Shakti and the soul is the Mantra” – meaning true magic happens when cosmic power (deity), natural energy (planet), and the aspirant’s soul unite through sound and intention​

.Finally, this integrated decan practice can be a living “book of hours”: as the decans change roughly every 10 days (or every 40 minutes if tracking ascendant decans), one can adapt one’s meditation, music, or ritual focus accordingly, creating a rhythmic cycle of attunement throughout the year. It fulfills what Ficino sought – to “bring the music of the spheres to earth”​
CULTUREANDCOSMOS.ORG
 – and what the tantric yogis sought – to realize the body as a microcosm of the divine sound. In a world where East and West’s wisdom are now available to be combined, the 36 decans provide a perfect structural canvas on which to paint a truly universal esoteric practice.Sources:
