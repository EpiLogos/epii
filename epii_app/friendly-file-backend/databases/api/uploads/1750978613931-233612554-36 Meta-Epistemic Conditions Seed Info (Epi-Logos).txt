**Meta-Epistemic Framework Overview**

The **Epi-Logos Quaternary Logic** operates on six integrated systems (0–5), each with nested subsystems (x.0–x.5), making up the full **Meta-Epistemic Framework**.

**0: Archetypal-Numerical Foundation - My own buildings upon Jung (and Pauli) **

**Core Role**: The ground and seed potential of the entire system.  
**Subsystems**:

- **0.0**: Originating potential.
- **0.1**: Material grounding (what).
- **0.2**: Active process (how).
- **0.3**: Mediating identity (who).
- **0.4**: Contextual field (when and where), nesting the system:

- **0.4.0–0.4.5**: Nested reflection of potential, what, how, who, where/when, and why.

- **0.5**: Purpose (why), synthesizing the whole.

  

**1: Causal Lens - My own buildings upon Aristotle **

**Core Role**: Explores causality within the system.  
**Subsystems**:

- **1.0**: Primordial cause (implicit potential).
- **1.1**: Material cause (what).
- **1.2**: Efficient cause (how).
- **1.3**: Formal cause (who/mediating structure).
- **1.4**: Final cause (when and where/contextual expression), nesting the system:

- **1.4.0–1.4.5**: Nested reflection within final causality.

- **1.5**: Will as quintessence (why/purpose).

  

**2: Logical Lens (Tetralemma) - My own buildings upon Nagarjuna's Tetralemma **

**Core Role**: Navigates affirmation, negation, integration, and transcendence.  
**Subsystems**:

- **2.0**: The query or question (potential).
- **2.1**: Affirmation (is).
- **2.2**: Negation (is not).
- **2.3**: Integration (both is and is not).
- **2.4**: Transcendence (neither is nor is not), nesting the system:

- **2.4.0–2.4.5**: Nested reflection within transcendence.

- **2.5**: Synthesized response (why/purpose), logical or symbolic.

  

**3: Processual Lens - My own buildings on Whiteheads Process Ontology and Concrescence (not yet in Whiteheadean language, but in natural symbols)**

**Core Role**: Tracks stages of becoming.  
**Subsystems**:

- **3.0**: Soil (foundation/potential).
- **3.1**: Seeding (initiation).
- **3.2**: Sprouting (active emergence).
- **3.3**: Blooming (structural unfolding).
- **3.4**: Flowering (contextual expression), nesting the system:

- **3.4.0–3.4.5**: Nested reflection within flowering.

- **3.5**: Maturity (synthesis/renewal).

  

**4: Meta-Epistemic Lens - Knowledge domains**

**Core Role**: Contextualizes and organizes knowledge.  
**Subsystems**:

- **4.0**: Ajnana (implicit unknowing).
- **4.1**: Ontology (what/being).
- **4.2**: Epistemology (how/knowing).
- **4.3**: Psychology (mediating structure).
- **4.4**: Contextual domain (when and where/ inquiry/epistemic field), nesting the system:

- **4.4.0–4.4.5**: Nested reflection within epistemic context.

- **4.5**: Jnana (wholistic Knowing/why).

  

**5: Divine-Scalar Lens - Can hold room for resonant concepts like bedhabedha and the Para Vak stages to switch out with the Para-apara language (as per the 6 lenses possible at the 5 level - future developments)**

**Core Role**: Synthesizes all elements into unity.  
**Subsystems**:

- **5.0**: Mystery/Anuttara (undifferentiated potential).
- **5.1**: Para (non-dual archetypes/metaphysical perspective).
- **5.2**: Parapara (Supreme-cum-Non-Supreme, archetypal unconscious).
- **5.3**: Parapara (Non-Supreme-cum-Supreme, conscious mediation).
- **5.4**: Apara (dualistic lived world/differentiation), nesting the system:

- **5.4.0–5.4.5**: Nested reflection within differentiation.

- **5.5**: Siva-Sakti (pragmatic unity/why).

#5.0: Mystery/Anuttara corresponds to the ground beyond even Para - the absolute undifferentiated potential from which Para emerges

#5.1: Para represents the non-dual archetypal level - pure consciousness containing all potential in unity

#5.2-#5.3: Parapara (Supreme-Non-Supreme) corresponds to Pasyanti and Madhyama - the intermediate states where differentiation begins while maintaining connection to unity

#5.4: Apara aligns with Vaikhari - the fully differentiated, manifest expression

#5.5: Siva-Sakti represents the pragmatic unity where differentiation and unity are recognized as inseparable aspects of a single reality
