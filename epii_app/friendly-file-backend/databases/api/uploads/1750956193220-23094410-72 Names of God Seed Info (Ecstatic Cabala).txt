# 72 Names of God (Kabbalistic)

**Origin and Derivation:** The “72 Names of God” refer to a sequence of **72 three-letter divine names** derived from a specific biblical source. The origin lies in **Exodus 14:19–21**, three consecutive verses each containing **72 Hebrew letters**​

. Kabbalistic tradition (dating back at least to the _Sefer Bahir_ and commentaries by Rashi) teaches that by writing the first verse normally, the second verse **in reverse order** (boustrophedonically), and the third verse normally, one can read **72 columns of three letters** each – forming 72 sacred triplets​

. These 72 triplets are considered **the 72 Names of G-d** (sometimes collectively called the _Shem ha-Mephorash_, “the Explicit Name”)​

. Each triplet is not exactly a pronounceable word in Hebrew, but rather a **mystical cipher of divine power**. According to the _Zohar_, the three verses correspond to the three fundamental divine attributes – **Chesed (loving-kindness), Gevurah (judgment/strength), and Tiferet (harmony)** – which together orchestrate God’s relationship with the world​

. Thus the 72 names, obtained by this interweaving of verses, represent a **composite Name of God made of mercy, severity, and harmony unified**​

[chabad.org](https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1388270/jewish/72-Names-of-G-d.htm#:~:text=In%20Hebrew%2C%20these%20three%20verses,manifests%20his%20attributes)

.

Kabbalistic texts emphasize the **structural symmetry** and numerology here: 72 three-letter names constitute **216 letters total**, which is 72×3. Notably, 72 is the numerical value of _חסד_ (**Chesed**, “mercy”) and 216 is the value of _גבורה_ (**Gevurah**, “strength/justice”)​

. This is not accidental – it indicates that the 72-name chain embodies the blending of Chesed and Gevurah (mercy and rigor) into **Tiferet** (beauty), the central balance​

[chabad.org](https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1388270/jewish/72-Names-of-G-d.htm#:~:text=states%2C%20the%20first%20verse%20is,G%E2%80%91d%27s%20goodness%20and%20glory%20rather)

. Indeed, the kabbalists say the first of the three Exodus verses (14:19) is Chesed (and is kept in direct order), the second verse (14:20) is Gevurah (written backward to indicate its more concealed, restrictive nature), and the third (14:21) is Tiferet (written forward, as it’s a direct revelation of God’s glory)​

. Aligning the letters in parallel yields the 72 triplets which encapsulate this **harmonious blend of forces**. In other words, the procedure itself is a kind of letter-math that fuses kindness, severity, and compassion into a single powerful matrix of divine names.

**Traditional Significance and Use:** From early on, these 72 names were regarded as extraordinarily powerful. **Legends** state that Moses invoked the 72-letter Name to part the Red Sea​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash#:~:text=boustrophedonically%20,29)

, and that knowledge of this Name enabled later holy men to work miracles – **casting out demons, healing the sick, averting natural disasters, even stopping the sun**​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash#:~:text=boustrophedonically%20,29)

. In Kabbalah, the 72 names are often viewed as **channels** through which divine energy flows into creation. The _Sefer Raziel HaMalakh_ (a medieval compendium of angelic and mystical knowledge) gives great importance to the 72-fold Name​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash#:~:text=The%2072,Kabbalist%20legends%20state%20that%20the)

, listing it as a key to angelic secrets. Early commentators like Rashi (1040–1105) and texts like _Sefer ha-Bahir_ (12th c.) explicitly describe the method of derivation, indicating this lore was mainstream in mystical circles​

. An oft-cited Midrash says “God has a Name of 72 letters” and hints at its use in **Genesis and Creation**​

[livekabbalah.org](https://livekabbalah.org/the-72-names-of-god/#:~:text=,be%20found%20in%20Parashat%20BeShalah)

. By the Geonic period, the 72 names were discussed in works attributed to Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKanah and Rabbi Akiva (the _Sefer HaYashar_ cited in later sources)​

[livekabbalah.org](https://livekabbalah.org/the-72-names-of-god/#:~:text=is%20even%20defined%20as%20the,Rashi%E2%80%98s)

. Moshe Cordovero (1522–1570), a leading Safed Kabbalist, also identifies the 72-Name as the _Shem HaMephorash_ (Explicit Name) in some contexts​

[livekabbalah.org](https://livekabbalah.org/the-72-names-of-god/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20wisdom%20of,Midrash%20Rabba%2C%20Genesis%2C%20Midrash%2019)

.

Kabbalists assigned **specific meanings or uses** to each of the 72 triplets. While the names themselves are just combinations of letters (like _Ve-Hu-Yah_, _Yo-Li-Ta_, etc.), later traditions (especially Practical Kabbalah) associated each triplet with an angel and a particular **sphere of influence**. For example, by adding either _-el_ or _-yah_ to each triplet, one gets 72 angelic names (e.g. _Vehuiah_, _Yeliel_, etc.), known as the “72 Angels of the Name.” Johann Reuchlin (a Christian Kabbalist, 16th c.) noted that _each of the 72 names can be seen as an **angel** – an individuated product of God’s will, rooted in the permutations of the Tetragrammaton_​

. In Jewish Kabbalah, this idea was already present: there was a belief in **72 guardian angels** or intelligences, each corresponding to one of the names and governing 5° of the zodiac (since 72×5° = 360°, covering the full circle of sky). Gikatilla and Abulafia (13th c. kabbalists) describe ranks of angels through which one approaches God, often involving letter combinations​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash#:~:text=early%20Jewish%20mystics%20developed%20an,35)

. One scholarly summary explains _“They taught that the universe was divided into ten angelic spheres…There were seventy-two inferior angels through whom the [divine] intermediaries could be approached. Contact with this celestial world was achieved by manipulating the letters of the Hebrew alphabet… a technique traceable in the works of Joseph Gikatilla and the famous Abraham Abulafia.”_​

. In other words, the 72 Names function as a **cosmological framework**: the Names are like keys to 72 angelic doorways, bridging our world and the Divine. Practical Kabbalists and magicians (including those who wrote under Solomon’s name) created methods to invoke these names for specific outcomes. For instance, each of the 72 angels (formed from the names) was believed to offer help in particular matters: one for traveling safely, one for enhancing memory, one for love, one for protection from evil, etc. This is evidenced in occult manuals and even early modern grimoires – e.g. **Liber Semamphoras** (Latin, 13th c.) which is based on _Sefer Raziel_ lore, details workings with the 72-fold name​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash#:~:text=Liber%20Semamphoras%20%20,39)

. In Jewish practice, open use of these names was restricted due to their sanctity, but they appear in _meditative prayers, amulets, and esoteric commentaries_. The _Meditation on the 72 Names_ is a known practice in some Kabbalistic schools (and has been popularized in modern Kabbalah movements), where one visualizes or chants the letter-triplets to effect spiritual purification or specific results.

**Systemic Structures in Kabbalistic Numerology:** The 72 Names are deeply embedded in Kabbalistic _“math.”_ We already noted the **72 = Chesed, 216 = Gevurah** equivalence, reflecting mercy tempered by judgment​

[livekabbalah.org](https://livekabbalah.org/the-72-names-of-god/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20wisdom%20of,Midrash%20Rabba%2C%20Genesis%2C%20Midrash%2019)

. Additionally, Kabbalists speak of **Four expansions of the Tetragrammaton (YHVH)**, corresponding to different filling techniques (with Alephs, Hehs, Yods) that yield names of gematria 72, 63, 45, and 52. The 72-letter Name (sometimes called *Shem ‘AB’ = 72, after the gematria of Av, “72”) corresponds to the highest of these expansions – associated with divine Father aspect (Abba) or the archetypal world of Atziluth in Lurianic Kabbalah​

. _“They are called by the names 72, 63, 45, and 52, and correspond to the Partzufim…these names of God constitute a vast and complex map of the divine structure – linguistic symbols denoting various discrete concentrations of divine power.”_​

[rssb.org](https://rssb.org/the-mystic-heart-of-judaism18.html#:~:text=by%20the%20names%2072%2C%2063%2C,As%20such%2C%20they%20are%20not)

. In simpler terms, the 72-Name is part of a **system of divine names** that map to the Tree of Life: 72 (Chokhmah/Abba), 63 (Binah/Imma), 45 (Zeir Anpin), 52 (Nukva). Thus, beyond its use in practical magic, the 72-letter Name is a theoretical linchpin in Lurianic cosmology – it represents the **primordial configuration of kindness** in the Godhead, and is used in meditations to unify the sephirot. Moses Cordovero and later Isaac Luria both wrote about unifying the divine name expansions in prayer (e.g. during certain parts of Jewish prayer, one would meditate on the name corresponding to that liturgical section). For example, the Kedushah might involve envisioning the 72-name shining in one’s heart to channel Chesed.

Furthermore, the number 72 appears repeatedly in Biblical and Kabbalistic contexts – there were 70 elders plus Moses and Aaron (total 72) receiving divine spirit, 72 _translators_ of the Septuagint, etc., which Kabbalists see as manifestations of the 72-fold mercy. In the human soul, it’s said there are 72 aspects (related to the 72 names) that one can rectify. In astrological Kabbalah, as mentioned, the 72 angels rule 72 quinances (5-day periods) aligning with the 360° zodiac, thus tying the 72 Name to time cycles as well. Some also connect 72 with the Hebrew word _chasid_ (devotee of mercy) and with the concept of _Gilgul_ (reincarnation cycles, as 72 is 8 x 9, numbers of infinity and truth in some systems).

**Angelic Attributions:** The traditional Kabbalistic commentaries (e.g. by Moses Cordovero in _Pardes Rimonim_ or Hayim Vital in _Shaarei Kedushah_) enumerate how to derive the **72 angels** from the Names. Generally, one takes each 3-letter name and appends _-iah_ or _-iel_. Half of the angels end in _-el_ (“of God”) and half in _-iah_ (a form of YH, “of the Lord”), alternating through the list. These angels are often listed with their specific role and a Psalm verse that includes their name acrostically. For instance, the first name is _Vav-Heh-Vav_; adding _-iah_ gives the angel _Vehuiah_, who is traditionally said to help with willpower and new beginnings, and corresponds to 0°–5° Aries in some occult correspondences. While Cordovero and Abulafia don’t give a zodiacal scheme (that came later in European magic), they do discuss the **meditative use** of these angels/names. Abulafia, in his prophetic Kabbalah, designed exercises of permuting letters (tzeruf) using the 72 triplets to achieve ecstatic states. He considered these names as focuses for attaining _devekut_ (union with the Divine Intellect). _Sefer Raziel_ (circa 13th century) includes the 72 names inscribed in a magical diagram, and an angel named Raziel supposedly teaches how to utter them for various effects​

. However, these operations were often kept secret due to the potential danger – improper use of the Shem ha-Mephorash was believed to backfire spiritually.

In **Christian Kabbalah and Hermeticism**, the 72 angels were eagerly taken up. Reuchlin in _De Arte Cabbalistica_ (1517) lists all 72 angel names and emphasizes that _through them, one ascends spiritually_, as they “illuminate and enhance man’s return to God”​

. He viewed the angels as emanations of the Tetragrammaton’s power, a concept directly inherited from Jewish sources. Influenced by this, Cornelius Agrippa incorporated the 72 angels in his occult system, pairing them with the 72 demons of the Goetia in a sort of symmetry (though that pairing is more a later development in ceremonial magic). In Jewish Kabbalah, there is also a notion of 72 names of mercy versus 72 names of wrath, but typically the 72 triplets of Exodus are all merciful. However, when misused or inverted, they could be a source of _Klipot_ (husks/evil forces), so one had to be pure of heart to work with them.

**Systemic Role:** The 72 Names of God exemplify the Kabbalistic principle that **letters and numbers underlie creation**. They form a **matrix of divine attributes** that is highly structured and mathematically elegant, preserving “structural integrity” from primary texts. For example, the array of 72 triplets is sometimes arranged in a **72×3 grid** or a wheel of 72 segments, used as a kind of symbolic map. The _Zohar_ says these letters shone in the sky at the Red Sea, illustrating their cosmic status​

[chabad.org](https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1388270/jewish/72-Names-of-G-d.htm#:~:text=The%20fact%20that%20each%20verse,1)

. In Lurianic Kabbalah, each of the 72 names can be correlated to specific joints or parts of Adam Kadmon (the Primordial Man), integrating with the notion that the body of God (so to speak) has 248 limbs, etc., of which 72 are particularly associated with Chesed – thus the 72 names are like the “chasers” pumping divine kindness into the universe.

To summarize, the 72 Names of God represent a **comprehensive esoteric structure**: _72_ sacred formulae generated through a precise combinatorial method, each linked to angels, elements of creation, and facets of the soul. They maintain theoretical coherence by being rooted in biblical verses and sephirotic attributes, and they allow for systemic interrelations – e.g. between **letters and angels, astrology and angels, God’s mercy and numerical symbolism** – which later kabbalists and occultists could draw upon for making rich associations. Primary sources like the Zohar and early commentaries treat the 72 Names with reverence, seeing in them a **microcosm of the entire schema of divine emanation**. Secondary sources (Cordovero, Abulafia, etc.) elaborated techniques to utilize this structure (meditations, letter permutations) without altering its fundamental “mathematical” design. Thus, the 72 Names function as a standalone mystical system: an alphabet of creation that can be studied on its own terms and also correlated with other systems (for instance, one might later explore correspondences between the 72 Names and the 36 decans or 36 tattvas – noticing, for example, that _72 = 2×36_, suggesting each decan could conceptually pair with two of the 72 names, one perhaps more benefic and one more malefic – such associations are speculative but possible once each system is **comprehensively understood on its own**). At this stage, we focus on the internal logic of the 72 Names: they are a **bridge between scripture and mysticism**, showing how numeric patterns in Torah become a lattice of holy names, each a key to unlock spiritual potentials. As one Kabbalist writes, _“The 72 triplets are not arbitrary – they are the unfolding of G‑d’s unlimited light filtered through the matrix of Chesed–Gevurah–Tiferet, thus giving us 72 tools to affect reality and ascend back to the source.”_​
