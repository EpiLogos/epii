The Eight Trigrams (Bagua / 八卦)[1][2][3][4][5]

Note on Binary Representation: The binary code uses the convention: Top line = Most Significant Bit (MSB), Bottom line = Least Significant Bit (LSB). Yang = 1, Yin = 0.
Note on Directions: The "Later Heaven" (Hòutiān Bāguà / 後天八卦) directions are most commonly used for cycles, seasons, Feng Shui, and I Ching hexagram dynamics. The "Earlier Heaven" (Xiāntiān Bāguà / 先天八卦) directions represent a primordial, balanced state and are often used in deeper cosmological or internal alchemy contexts.

Binary Representation: 010001

Lower Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Upper Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Symbolic Description: Represents the difficult, obstructed, and potentially chaotic situation encountered right at the beginning of a new undertaking. It's like a tender sprout (Thunder: movement, initiative from below) trying to push through resistant soil or navigate a storm (Water: danger, the abyss above). There is inherent potential and energy for growth, but it faces immediate obstacles and requires careful navigation, patience, and the seeking of capable helpers or guidance. Reckless pushing leads to failure; establishing order and finding support are crucial.

Hexagram Image: ䷃ (Mountain over Water)

Binary Representation: 100010

Lower Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Upper Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Symbolic Description: Represents ignorance, inexperience, and the potential for learning, symbolized by a spring (Water: obscurity, potential, the unknown) emerging at the foot of a mountain (Mountain: stillness, stopping, obstruction). The mountain blocks clear view or easy progress, while the water below is obscure and potentially perilous due to lack of understanding. This hexagram often describes the relationship between student and teacher. Folly itself isn't negative but requires guidance. The teacher should be patient and clear; the student sincere, persistent, and respectful (not asking the same thing repeatedly once answered properly). It points to the need to dispel ignorance through proper education.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth over Water. Stillness/stopping/solidity (Mountain/Earth) sits atop depth/danger/obscurity/flow (Water). Suggests potential blocked by ignorance, lack of clarity, or immaturity. Also implies a hidden source (spring) needing guidance to emerge constructively.

Direction (Later Heaven): The Northeast (Mountain/stillness, gate) affects or covers the North (Water/depth, obscurity). A state of being stopped or enclosed before fully emerging from the unknown.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Winter / Early Spring transition. The time when potential (Water) exists but is held back, covered, or not yet ready (Mountain), needing the right conditions or guidance (teaching) to proceed.

Body: Potential issues related to Kidneys/Ears (Water/hidden problems, lack of hearing/understanding) and Back/Hands/Joints (Mountain/blockages, inability to act or grasp). Mental fog, lack of clarity, stubbornness (Mountain) combined with hidden anxieties (Water).

Social Role: Student/Teacher dynamic, Apprentice, Beginner, Child needing instruction, someone facing the unknown, feeling confused or unenlightened. The Youngest Son (stillness, contemplation) encountering the domain of the Middle Son (hidden depths, danger).

Key Imagery/Keywords: Ignorance, Inexperience, Education, Guidance Needed, Obscurity, Hidden Spring, Fog, Mist, Teacher, Student, Need for Clarity, Patience (from teacher), Sincerity (from student), Covering, Enveloping Darkness, Immaturity.

Hexagram Image: ䷄ (Water over Heaven)

Binary Representation: 010111

Lower Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Upper Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Symbolic Description: This hexagram signifies a time of necessary waiting or pause. Strength and potential (Heaven below) are present, but face an obstacle or danger ahead (Water above), like clouds gathering before rain. Rushing forward would be perilous. The appropriate action is to wait with patience, sincerity, and inner strength. During this pause, one should focus on nourishment – both literal (eating, resting) and metaphorical (building inner resources, consolidating strength). Confidence that the waiting period will eventually end successfully is key.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Water over Heaven (Metal). Water's danger or obscurity temporarily halts or challenges the strong, creative force of Heaven. Potential is held back.

Direction (Later Heaven): The North (Water/danger) lies ahead of the Northwest (Heaven/strength). A situation where forward movement encounters obstacles.

Season (Later Heaven): Winter conditions (Water) over the Late Autumn potential (Heaven). Energy is consolidating but must wait for the right time to emerge.

Body: Potential issues with Kidneys/Ears (Water/fear, hidden problems) above the Head/Lungs/Bones (Heaven/strength, vitality). Holding back energy.

Social Role: The Middle Son (danger, waiting) influencing the Father (strength, initiative). A leader needing to pause before action, or potential being held in check by circumstances.

Binary Representation: 111010

Lower Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Upper Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Symbolic Description: Represents contention, disputes, litigation, and conflict. The outward-striving, strong nature (Heaven above) clashes with the dangerous, hidden, or inwardly directed nature (Water below). There's a fundamental opposition of forces or intentions. The hexagram strongly advises caution: avoid initiating or escalating conflict. Seeking impartial arbitration or wise counsel ('the great man') is recommended. Persisting in conflict leads to misfortune, even if one feels initially justified. Finding a middle ground or withdrawing is often the wiser course.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Heaven (Metal) over Water. Assertive strength (Heaven) tries to dominate or move against hidden danger, depth, or contention (Water). A dynamic of opposition.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northwest (Heaven/authority) asserting itself over the North (Water/danger, hidden motives). Conflict between overt power and underlying issues.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Autumn (Heaven/consolidation) clashes with Winter (Water/stagnation, depth). A time of potential strife and opposition.

Lower Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Represents disciplined organization, collective action, and leadership, symbolized by an army. Water (danger, hidden potential, the masses needing direction) is contained and structured within Earth (receptivity, obedience, the ground). Success requires strong, experienced, and virtuous leadership (represented by the single Yang line, ideally in the second place) trusted by the masses (Yin lines). Discipline, a clear and legitimate purpose, and careful strategy are essential. It relates to any situation requiring organized collective effort to overcome a challenge or achieve a shared goal.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth over Water. The stability and receptivity of Earth contain, organize, and give structure to the potentially dangerous or chaotic flow of Water. Discipline imposed on potential.

Direction (Later Heaven): Southwest (Earth/the masses) over the North (Water/danger, the hidden). Organizing the populace or resources to deal with a threat or challenge.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Summer (Earth/maturity, abundance) providing structure for Winter's potential (Water). Mobilizing resources.

Upper Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Symbolic Description: Represents union, alliance, seeking support, and holding together. Water (flowing, adapting, seeking the path of least resistance) flows over Earth (receptive, supportive, providing form). Like water naturally finding its place on the land, union should arise organically and be centered around a worthy, capable, and central figure (represented by the single Yang line, ideally in the fifth place). Sincerity, mutual support, and self-reflection (checking one's own suitability for union) are vital. Those who hesitate or come late to the union may find themselves excluded.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Water over Earth. The adapting, flowing nature of Water finds support, form, and place upon the receptive Earth. A natural relationship of support and belonging.

Direction (Later Heaven): North (Water/flow, community) over Southwest (Earth/support, the masses). Water finding its place on land, social cohesion.

Season (Later Heaven): Winter's flow (Water) over Late Summer's receptive ground (Earth). Finding connections and support.

Body: Kidneys/Ears (Water/flow, social connection) finding support from the Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/grounding, nourishment). Sense of belonging, community health.

Social Role: The Middle Son (Water/seeking connection) interacting with the Mother (Earth/providing support). Seeking mentorship, joining groups, finding one's place in a community or family, loyalty.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Water on the Earth, Natural Flow finding Form, Alliance, Community, Support, Seeking Union, Central Leadership Figure, Loyalty, Mutual Benefit, Belonging, Closeness, Affinity.

Binary Representation: 110111

Symbolic Description: This hexagram signifies gentle restraint or influence yielding small, gradual successes. The gentle, penetrating Wind blows over the powerful Heaven, representing a subtle force holding back or guiding a stronger one. It suggests accumulating progress bit by bit, like dense clouds gathering potential but not yet bringing rain. Direct confrontation is avoided; instead, subtle persuasion, patience, and minor adjustments tame the situation. Focus on small details and cultivate virtue.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Direction (Later Heaven): Southeast (Wind/gentle influence) interacting with Northwest (Heaven/strong power). Persuasion or subtle guidance directed towards authority.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Spring/Early Summer (Wind/growth, influence) meets Late Autumn (Heaven/consolidated power). Gentle growth encountering established force, needing careful handling.

Heaven (strength, authority) is above the Lake (joy, openness, vulnerability). It depicts the powerful interacting with the potentially fragile or unpredictable.

Binary Representation: 000111

Lower Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Represents harmony, peace, prosperity, and a time of smooth, successful flow. Heaven (creative Yang energy) is below, tending upward, while Earth (receptive Yin energy) is above, tending downward. This natural interaction and communication between the primal forces brings balance and flourishing. High and low connect, leading to understanding and mutual benefit.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Summer (Earth/fruition) influenced beneficially by the rising potential of Late Autumn (Heaven). A time of stable prosperity and well-being.

Body: Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/nourishment, grounding) in harmonious communication with Head/Lungs (Heaven/spirit, breath). Bodily harmony, free flow of Qi, good health.

Hexagram Image: ䷋ (Heaven over Earth)

Binary Representation: 111000

Lower Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Upper Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Symbolic Description: Represents stagnation, obstruction, decline, and lack of communication. Heaven is above and tends upward; Earth is below and tends downward. Unlike in Peace (Tai), the forces move away from each other, severing connection. Communication between high and low is blocked, energy does not flow harmoniously. This signifies a time of discord, where inferior elements may seem to gain influence. The wise person avoids entanglement in base affairs, withdraws, preserves integrity, and waits for conditions to change.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Metal (Heaven) over Earth. Heaven (Yang) moves up and away, Earth (Yin) moves down and away. They separate, leading to a lack of productive interaction and stagnation.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northwest (Heaven/authority) separates from Southwest (Earth/the masses, foundation). Disconnection, lack of understanding between leadership and populace.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Autumn (Heaven/potential) is disconnected from Late Summer (Earth/nourishment). Potential cannot be actualized; resources don't reach where needed.

Body: Head/Lungs (Heaven/spirit, breath) disconnected from Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/nourishment, grounding). Poor circulation of Qi, feeling blocked, stifled, lack of vitality.

Social Role: Father (authority) is separate and distant from the Mother (receptive foundation, the people). Lack of communication, misunderstanding, stagnation in society or partnerships, bureaucratic blockage.

Fire below illuminates and warms, while Heaven above provides strength and overarching direction. Success comes from shared goals, public transparency, and overcoming selfish or hidden biases.

Binary Representation: 101111

Lower Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Upper Trigram: Lí (Fire)

Symbolic Description: Signifies abundance, great possessions, wealth, and success. Fire (clarity, brilliance) is high above Heaven (strength, substance), like the sun illuminating everything below. This indicates a time of peak achievement and influence. Crucially, the hexagram often emphasizes the importance of humility, modesty, and fairness in managing this abundance (symbolized by the single Yin line, ideally in the ruling 5th place).

Hexagram Image: ䷎ (Earth over Mountain)

Binary Representation: 000100

Lower Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Represents humility, modesty, and the principle of achieving balance by bringing down the high and elevating the low. The Mountain (normally high and imposing) places itself beneath the receptive Earth (normally lower or foundational). This voluntary self-decrease creates equilibrium and allows for smooth functioning and success. Modesty is shown not as weakness, but as a source of strength and sustainability, recognized and rewarded by cosmic law.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth (Yin) over Earth (Yang/Mountain). A doubling of Earth suggests stability, but the key dynamic is the receptive Yin Earth above the usually prominent Yang Earth (Mountain), symbolizing the leveling principle.

Direction (Later Heaven): Southwest (Earth/receptive, broad) positioned over Northeast (Mountain/still, defined). Broad receptivity encompassing defined stillness, creating balance.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Summer (Earth/fruition) providing context for Late Winter (Mountain/stillness). Balancing abundance with inner quietude.

Body: Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/receptive, nourishing) over Back/Hands/Joints (Mountain/structure, stillness). Groundedness and flexibility tempering rigidity or pride.

Social Role: The Mother (Earth/receptive) interacting with the Youngest Son (Mountain/contemplative, perhaps stubborn). Experience and receptivity guiding or balancing youthful assertion or withdrawal. Represents fairness and social balance.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Mountain Hidden within the Earth, Humility, Modesty, Equilibrium, Balance, Reducing the High, Elevating the Low, Fairness, Effortless Success (due to balance), Inner Strength through Yielding, Self-Correction.

Binary Representation: 001000

Lower Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Upper Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Symbolic Description: Signifies enthusiasm, movement, excitement, and mobilizing energy. Thunder (movement, initiative) bursts forth from the receptive Earth (masses, foundation). This often follows a period of humility (Hex 15) and represents a time for inspiring action, setting things in motion, and potentially celebration (associated with music). The single Yang line (ideally 4th place) leads the receptive Yin lines. Foresight is needed to ensure enthusiasm is well-directed and doesn't devolve into aimless pleasure or recklessness. It implies preparing for the future and inspiring collective participation.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Wood (Thunder) over Earth. Wood emerges from and draws energy from Earth. Dynamic action springs from a supportive, receptive base.

Direction (Later Heaven): East (Thunder/initiative) arising from the Southwest (Earth/masses, foundation). New movement beginning from a grounded position.

Season (Later Heaven): Spring (Thunder/new growth) bursting forth from Late Summer's potential (Earth/stored energy). A surge of new energy.

Body: Feet/Liver (Thunder/movement, drive) being supported or activated by the Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/nourishment, grounding). Action fueled by resources.

Social Role: The Eldest Son (Thunder/initiative) rousing or leading the Mother (Earth/the collective). Leadership inspiring participation, mobilizing resources, creating excitement.

Binary Representation: 011001

Lower Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Upper Trigram: Duì (Lake)

Symbolic Description: Represents following, adapting, and moving in response to leadership or changing conditions. Thunder (arousing movement) is below, initiating action, while the Lake (joy, openness) is above, responding pleasurably. This suggests willingly following a worthy cause or leader, or adapting joyfully to the flow of events. Success depends on the sincerity of the follower and the worthiness of what is followed.

Hexagram Image: ䷑ (Mountain over Wind)

Binary Representation: 100110

Lower Trigram: Xùn (Wind)

Upper Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Symbolic Description: Represents decay, stagnation, and the need to repair what has been damaged, often stemming from neglect or complacency (Wind below creates conditions for rot, which is then arrested or becomes apparent by Mountain's stillness above). It signifies correcting errors, often those inherited from the past (sometimes specifically parental failings). This requires decisive action, effort, and careful consideration ("crossing the great water"). It's a time for mending, reforming, and taking responsibility for fixing problems.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth (Mountain) over Wood (Wind). Earth smothers or arrests the gentle penetration of Wood/Wind. Stillness imposed upon gentle influence can lead to stagnation or reveal existing decay. Effort is needed to overcome this blockage.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northeast (Mountain/stillness, stopping) imposes upon Southeast (Wind/gentle penetration, passivity). Stagnation resulting from lack of decisive action or gentle influences being blocked.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Winter (Mountain/endings) meets Late Spring (Wind/gentle growth). A blockage or corruption halting natural development.

Body: Back/Hands/Joints (Mountain/stillness, blockage) affecting Thighs/Hips/Respiratory system (Wind/gentle flow, breath). Stiffness, blockage, corruption requiring cleansing or repair.

Social Role: The Youngest Son (Mountain/stopping, contemplating) dealing with issues caused by the Eldest Daughter (Wind/passivity, indecision). Addressing problems arising from neglect or inherited flaws.

Binary Representation: 000011

Lower Trigram: Duì (Lake)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Signifies approach, arrival, overseeing, and the beneficial influence of a superior presence drawing near to those below. Earth (receptive, nurturing) is above the Lake (joyful, open), depicting benevolent authority or positive conditions nearing the people or situation. This is generally an auspicious time of growth and good fortune, but it carries a warning: this favorable period is temporary (like the waxing phase of the year) and will decline ("Approach of the eighth month brings misfortune"). Enjoy the positive trend but remain mindful and prepared for future changes.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth over Metal (Lake). Earth nurtures and supports Metal. Receptivity and care foster joy and openness.

Direction (Later Heaven): Southwest (Earth/masses, nurturing) interacts beneficially with West (Lake/joy, community). The collective supporting joyful expression or benevolent leadership reaching the people.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Summer (Earth/maturity) provides context for Autumn's expression (Lake/joy, harvest). A time of benevolent oversight and shared benefit. Corresponds to the growing Yang phase after Winter Solstice.

Social Role: The Mother (Earth/nurturing, overseeing) approaches the Youngest Daughter (Lake/joyful, receptive). Benign authority, teaching, mentorship, positive influence drawing near.

Upper Trigram: Xùn (Wind)

Symbolic Description: Represents contemplation, viewing from a higher perspective, observing patterns, and being observed as an example. Wind (gentle influence, penetration) moves over the Earth (receptive masses, the broad view), suggesting a vantage point from which to understand things or influence subtly through presence. It implies looking and being looked at. Often associated with sacred rituals (ablution before sacrifice) or the leader setting a model for the people. Understanding comes through detached observation rather than direct action.

Body: Thighs/Hips/Respiratory system (Wind/breath, subtle movement) influencing Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/grounding, receptivity). Calm observation affecting one's core state.

Social Role: The Eldest Daughter (Wind/gentle influence, understanding) observing or influencing the Mother (Earth/the collective). Gaining wisdom through observation, setting an example, influencing through subtle presence rather than command.

Upper Trigram: Lí (Fire)

Symbolic Description: Represents forcefully removing an obstruction, like biting through something tough that's stuck between the teeth. It signifies the need for decisive action, often in the context of administering justice, overcoming obstacles, or uniting things that have been separated. Clarity (Fire) combines with energetic movement (Thunder) to cut through difficulties. This requires firmness and fairness, like a clear legal judgment followed by enforcement.

Binary Representation: 100101

Symbolic Description: Represents beauty, grace, adornment, and attention to form. Fire (brightness, beauty) at the foot of the Mountain (stillness, substance) illuminates and beautifies its base. It signifies the importance of aesthetics and presentation, but warns against mistaking superficial form for true substance. Grace is appropriate for minor matters or adding beauty to underlying strength, but fundamental issues require substance, not just appearance.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Lower Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Upper Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Symbolic Description: Signifies disintegration, erosion, decline, and stripping away. The image is of a house or structure collapsing, represented by five Yin lines undermining the single remaining Yang line at the top (Mountain resting precariously on eroding Earth). It indicates a time when inferior forces are ascendant, and the foundation is crumbling. The advice for the superior person is not to act forcefully against the trend but to adapt, protect what is essential, and wait for the cycle to turn (leading to Hexagram 24, Return). It's a time for letting go, conserving energy, and yielding to unfavorable circumstances.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth (Mountain) over Earth (Kūn). The Yang Earth (structure) is being undermined by the Yin Earth (dissolution, receptivity to decay). Overwhelming Yin eroding Yang.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northeast (Mountain/structure) losing its foundation to the Southwest (Earth/dissolution). Structure collapsing.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Winter (Mountain/endings) meets Late Summer (Earth/full receptivity, beginning of decline). The peak of Yin influence eroding the last Yang.

Social Role: The Youngest Son (Mountain/holding on) being overwhelmed by the influence of the Mother (Earth/dissolving force). Collapse of established structures, loss of leadership influence, decline, necessity of retreat.

Lower Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Represents the turning point after extreme decline (Bō), signifying the return of light, hope, and positive energy. Thunder (Yang initiative) stirs beneath the receptive Earth (Yin), marking the beginning of a new cycle, like the Winter Solstice when daylight begins to increase. It's a time of natural, spontaneous return to goodness and strength. The advice is to recognize this subtle beginning, nurture it gently, and allow things to recover naturally without forcing them. Friends return, movement resumes.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Earth over Wood (Thunder). Earth provides the receptive ground from which new Wood energy can emerge. The beginning of action within receptivity.

Direction (Later Heaven): Southwest (Earth/receptive potential) gives rise to East (Thunder/new initiative). Movement beginning again from the depths.

Season (Later Heaven): Corresponds strongly to the Winter Solstice. Late Summer (Earth) provides the ground for Spring's first impulse (Thunder). The moment darkness turns to light.

Hexagram Image: ䷘ (Heaven over Thunder)

Binary Representation: 111001

Lower Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Upper Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Symbolic Description: Represents innocence, naturalness, acting without ulterior motives, and unexpected outcomes. Heaven (strength, nature's law) is above Thunder (movement, impulse). This suggests action that springs naturally from inherent correctness, aligned with the way of Heaven. It advises acting spontaneously and correctly according to the time, without calculating gain. However, it also warns that acting incorrectly, even without malice, or encountering unexpected external events can lead to misfortune. True innocence brings success if aligned with natural law.

Binary Representation: 100111

Lower Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Upper Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Symbolic Description: Signifies restraining great power, accumulating large resources, and holding potential in check. Mountain (firm stillness) above Heaven (great strength) indicates the containment and cultivation of powerful energy. Unlike "Small Accumulation" (Hex 9), this involves controlling substantial forces. It suggests not just holding back, but actively cultivating strength, character, and knowledge ("storing up the sayings and deeds of the past"). Success comes from firmness, building inner reserves, and waiting for the right time to release potential constructively ("Not eating at home brings good fortune" - implies drawing on wider resources or serving the public good).

Elements: Earth (Mountain) over Metal (Heaven). Earth contains or provides boundaries for Metal. Stillness and solidity restrain and cultivate great power.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northeast (Mountain/stopping, storing) influences Northwest (Heaven/strength, potential). Holding back and cultivating great power.

The image is likened to an open mouth, with firm lines (jaws) above and below, and receptive space between. Mountain (stillness) above and Thunder (movement) below suggest the necessary balance of rest and action in seeking or providing nourishment.

Hexagram Image: ䷛ (Lake over Wind)

Binary Representation: 011110

Lower Trigram: Xùn (Wind)

Upper Trigram: Duì (Lake)

Symbolic Description: Represents an extraordinary situation where the strong elements (Yang lines in the middle) are excessive, overpowering the weaker elements (Yin lines at the beginning and end). It's like a beam that is thick in the middle but weak at the ends, on the verge of collapse. This signifies pressure, stress, imbalance, and the need for exceptional measures. It calls for careful handling of a critical situation, finding support, and possibly taking unusual action ("It furthers one to have somewhere to go"). Success requires addressing the fundamental imbalance.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Metal (Lake) over Wood (Wind). Suggests excessive openness or pressure (Lake) on a potentially yielding foundation (Wind). Also, the solid core (Yang lines) outweighs the yielding exterior (Yin lines).

Direction (Later Heaven): West (Lake/openness, pressure) over Southeast (Wind/gentle foundation). The structure is overburdened.

Season (Later Heaven):: Autumn (Lake/maturity) meets Late Spring (Wind/flexibility). The weight of maturity or results strains the foundation.

Body: Mouth/Chest (Lake/pressure) over Thighs/Hips (Wind/support). Feeling overburdened, structural stress, potential collapse.

Social Role: The Youngest Daughter (Lake/expression, pressure) interacting with the Eldest Daughter (Wind/yielding support). A situation where the core is too strong or active for the supporting structures. Requires careful management of pressure.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Overheavy Beam, Weak Supports, Pressure, Stress, Extraordinary Situation, Imbalance, Need for Exceptional Action, Crisis, Potential Collapse, Overburdened, Seeking Support, Critical Moment.

Binary Representation: 010010

Lower Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Upper Trigram: Kǎn (Water)

Symbolic Description: Represents danger doubled, immersion in difficulties, pitfalls, and the abyss. Water is repeated, signifying compounded risk or being deep within a challenging situation. However, it also points to the potential for learning through practice and maintaining sincerity (the solid Yang line within each trigram) even amidst peril. Like water flowing onward despite obstacles, one must adapt, remain true to oneself, and persist to navigate the danger successfully. It emphasizes learning through repeated exposure and mastery gained through facing challenges.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Pure Water. Signifies deep immersion, flow, danger, the unconscious, hidden depths, and adaptability.

Direction (Later Heaven): North (N) - The place of maximum Yin, darkness, and potential danger.

Season (Later Heaven): Winter - The time of darkness, cold, and inward focus; potential hardship.

Body: Kidneys, ears, blood, bodily fluids. Potential for fear, anxiety, issues related to fluid balance or hidden ailments.

Binary Representation: 101101

Upper Trigram: Lí (Fire)

Symbolic Description: Represents brightness, clarity, consciousness, and attachment. Fire is repeated, signifying intense illumination and awareness, but also dependence, like fire needing fuel to burn. It highlights intellectual clarity, beauty, and visibility. Success comes from recognizing one's dependence (on correct principles, on nourishment) and cultivating inner docility and acceptance (like the gentle cow), allowing continuous illumination. It points to the power of awareness but also the potential danger of burning out or clinging too strongly.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Pure Fire. Signifies clarity, brightness, intelligence, awareness, heat, passion, and dependence.

Direction (Later Heaven): South (S) - The place of maximum Yang, brightness, and visibility.

Season (Later Heaven): Summer - The time of greatest light, heat, and outward expression.

Hexagram Image: ䷞ (Lake over Mountain)

Binary Representation: 011100

Lower Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Upper Trigram: Duì (Lake)

Symbolic Description: Represents mutual attraction, influence, stimulation, and courtship, particularly the interaction between opposites. The receptive, open Lake (youngest daughter) is above the firm, still Mountain (youngest son). This signifies a natural attraction and responsiveness, often without conscious intent initially. The Mountain's stillness provides the foundation for the Lake's joyful response. Success comes from remaining open and receptive (the empty space within the mountain) and allowing influence to occur naturally. It's the beginning phase of attraction.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Metal (Lake) over Earth (Mountain). Metal is produced from Earth; joy and openness arise from stillness and solidity. A productive and responsive relationship.

Direction (Later Heaven): West (Lake/joy, openness) responds to Northeast (Mountain/stillness, foundation). Attraction emerging from stability.

Season (Later Heaven): Autumn (Lake/pleasure) interacting with Late Winter (Mountain/potential). The awakening of connection.

Body: Mouth/Chest (Lake/expression, feeling) responding to Back/Hands/Joints (Mountain/stillness, grounding). Physical attraction, sensitivity, responsive feelings.

Binary Representation: 001110

Lower Trigram: Xùn (Wind)

Upper Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Symbolic Description: Represents permanence, continuity, endurance, and long-lasting relationships or situations, like a stable marriage. Thunder (movement, initiative) above Wind (gentle penetration, consistency) signifies dynamic action grounded in steady influence. This is the hexagram of established patterns, enduring principles, and commitment. Success comes from maintaining constancy in one's path and character, adapting movement to underlying principles. It follows Influence (Xian) as the establishment of an enduring state after initial attraction.

33. Dùn (遯) - Retreat

Hexagram Image: ䷠ (Heaven over Mountain)

Binary Representation: 111100

Lower Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Upper Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Symbolic Description: Represents timely and strategic withdrawal, not out of weakness, but to preserve strength. Heaven (strong, advancing) is above, while Mountain (stillness, stopping) is below. The image suggests Heaven moving away, pulling back from entanglement with inferior or obstructive forces represented by the growing Yin lines below (especially compared to Hex 12, Standstill, where Heaven is also above but over receptive Earth). It's a voluntary retreat to avoid damage and maintain integrity. Keeping distance, especially from negativity or 'small people', allows the superior person to remain unharmed and prepare for a better time.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Heaven (Metal) over Earth (Mountain). Strong Heaven withdraws from the stopping influence of the Mountain or the growing Yin it represents. Preserving strength by pulling back.

Direction (Later Heaven): Northwest (Heaven/power) pulling away from Northeast (Mountain/obstacle, stillness). Voluntary withdrawal from blockage.

Season (Later Heaven): Late Autumn (Heaven/consolidation) separating from Late Winter (Mountain/stopping). Pulling back energy before encountering full resistance.

Body: Head/Lungs (Heaven/strength) withdrawing from influence related to Back/Hands/Joints (Mountain/stillness, blockage). Conserving energy, avoiding strain or confrontation.

Social Role: The Father (Heaven/authority) withdrawing from the Youngest Son (Mountain/stubbornness, stopping). Strategic withdrawal, avoiding petty conflicts, maintaining dignity by distance, temporary retirement.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Voluntary Withdrawal, Strategic Retreat, Avoiding Conflict, Preserving Strength, Keeping Distance (from negativity), Disengagement, Prudence, Timing, Letting Go (temporarily), Maintaining Integrity.

Binary Representation: 001111

Lower Trigram: Qián (Heaven)

Upper Trigram: Zhèn (Thunder)

Symbolic Description: Represents great power, strength, and vigorous advance, but warns against its misuse. Thunder (powerful movement) is energized by Heaven (great strength) below. This indicates a peak of Yang energy and momentum. However, this power must be used correctly and aligned with justice and propriety. Reckless force or bullying leads to trouble. Strength should be tempered with awareness and consideration, avoiding arrogance or pushing beyond appropriate limits. The image is sometimes likened to a ram butting against a hedge - power needing direction.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Wood (Thunder) over Metal (Heaven). Wood's action is fueled by Heaven's strength. Suggests powerful, potentially impulsive movement derived from solid potential. Need for control as Wood is normally overcome by Metal (potential for self-damage if uncontrolled).

Direction (Later Heaven): East (Thunder/action) empowered by Northwest (Heaven/strength). Forceful initiative backed by great power.

Season (Later Heaven): Spring (Thunder/initiative) drawing on the power of Late Autumn (Heaven/consolidation). A potent surge of directed energy.

Body: Feet/Liver (Thunder/movement, drive) powered by Head/Lungs/Bones (Heaven/strength, structure). Great physical power, but potential for impulsive action or aggression if not managed by higher awareness.

Social Role: The Eldest Son (Thunder/action) empowered by the Father (Heaven/strength). Great potential for action, leadership asserting itself, but needs guidance and restraint to avoid recklessness.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Great Strength, Power, Vigorous Advance, Momentum, Need for Correctness and Restraint, Danger of Arrogance or Recklessness, Potential (for good or bad), Controlled Force, Determination.

This indicates growing influence, recognition, and expansion favored by circumstances. Often depicts a loyal subordinate or leader gaining favor and advancing under a higher authority. Progress is smooth and unopposed, but should be grounded in virtue and generosity to be sustainable.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Fire over Earth. Fire illuminates Earth, drawing its potential upward. Clarity and brightness expanding over a receptive foundation.

Direction (Later Heaven): South (Fire/clarity, expansion) arising from Southwest (Earth/receptivity, support). Growing influence and recognition.

Season (Later Heaven): Summer (Fire/peak brightness) drawing upon Late Summer (Earth/fruition). A time of visible advancement and reward.

Body: Eyes/Heart (Fire/clarity, vision) expanding influence over Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/support, nourishment). Growing awareness, vitality, and influence.

Social Role: The Middle Daughter (Fire/clarity, intelligence) advancing with the support of the Mother (Earth/receptive base, the people). Promotion, gaining favor, expanding influence, smooth advancement, recognition from superiors.

Binary Representation: 000101

Lower Trigram: Lí (Fire)

Upper Trigram: Kūn (Earth)

Symbolic Description: Represents the injury or concealment of brightness, intelligence being suppressed, and persecution during dark times. Fire (light, clarity) is beneath the Earth (darkness, obstruction), signifying wisdom forced underground or intelligence hidden due to hostile circumstances.

The advice is to conceal one's light, endure adversity with perseverance, maintain inner clarity while adapting outwardly to darkness, and protect oneself.

Direction (Later Heaven): Southwest (Earth/receptivity, the masses) obscures South (Fire/clarity, brilliance). The light is hidden or oppressed.

Body: Abdomen/Spleen (Earth/grounding, perhaps dullness) over Eyes/Heart (Fire/clarity, spirit). Inner light suppressed, vision obscured, potential for depression or hidden injury.

Social Role: The Mother (Earth/receptive, perhaps ignorant or oppressive force) suppressing the Middle Daughter (Fire/intelligence, clarity). Persecution of the wise, hiding one's talents, adversity, difficult political climate, inner perseverance needed.

Key Imagery/Keywords: Sun Setting or Hidden Below Earth, Injured Brightness, Hidden Intelligence, Persecution, Adversity, Need for Caution and Concealment, Protecting Inner Light, Enduring Dark Times, Maintaining Integrity Secretly.

Wind (gentle influence, external order) arises from Fire (clarity, inner light) below. This suggests that effective outward conduct and influence stem from inner clarity and correct relationships within the core unit. Emphasis is placed on distinct roles (father, mother, children; leader, members), loyalty, consistency, and the power of sincere words and conduct to maintain harmony. The woman's role (associated with the inner Fire) is often highlighted as central to the family's well-being.

Binary Representation: 101011

Lower Trigram: Duì (Lake)

Upper Trigram: Lí (Fire)

Symbolic Description: Represents fundamental opposition, divergence, misunderstanding, and alienation. Fire (rising upward) is above the Lake (seeping downward); their natures move in opposite directions. This signifies conflict arising from differing goals or perspectives, like two sisters living together but belonging to different men (different loyalties). While major union is difficult, the hexagram suggests that in small matters, finding common ground or temporary agreement might still be possible. It highlights diversity and the challenge of bridging fundamental gaps.

Overall Symbolic Associations:

Elements: Fire over Metal (Lake). Fire melts or controls Metal. Suggests inherent tension or conflict between clarity/passion (Fire) and joy/expression/materiality (Lake).

Hexagram Image: ䷦ (Water over Mountain)

Binary Representation: 010100

Lower Trigram: Gèn (Mountain)

Symbolic Description: Represents obstruction, hindrance, and difficulty in movement, like trying to walk with a limp or facing insurmountable obstacles.

Perseverance through withdrawal and finding support is key.

Simplicity and shedding complexities aid the process.
