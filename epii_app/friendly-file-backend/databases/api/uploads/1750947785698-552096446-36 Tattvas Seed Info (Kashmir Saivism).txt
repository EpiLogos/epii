# Kashmir Shaivism’s 36 Tattvas

**Overview:** In the non-dual Kashmir Shaivism (Trika) tradition, reality is categorized into **36 tattvas** (fundamental principles). These range from the transcendent Absolute (Śiva) down to the material elements (Earth). The tattvas explain **how the One consciousness self-manifests as the diverse universe**​

. They are grouped in a strict hierarchy of **levels** – from “pure” spiritual principles to “impure” material constituents​

. Each tattva has a specific **function and conceptual role** in the emanation of experience. The tattva schema is essentially a **map of manifestation**: consciousness descends through these 36 stages to appear as the limited world, and a yogi’s awareness ascends back through them in reverse to realize the Supreme​

**Five Pure Tattvas (Śuddha Tattvas):** These exist at the **absolute level** of reality, where only **Śiva-consciousness** operates​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Suddha%20tattvas%2C%20also%20known%20as,8)

. They correspond to the five divine acts (creation, maintenance, dissolution, concealment, grace)​

​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20Ishwara%20tattva,8)

. In these tattvas, there is no limitation or duality – they are “pure” because they arise directly from Śiva’s own nature​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Suddha%20tattvas%2C%20also%20known%20as,8)

. The five are:

- **Śiva** – _Pure Consciousness_ as the formless, omnipresent Self. It is the absolutely quiescent aspect of reality, **transcending all thought or action**​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=)
    
    . Shiva tattva is pure **Being** (sat) and light (prakāśa) without any object or desire.
- **Śakti** – _Divine Energy_ or the dynamic power of consciousness. Śakti (also called **Bindu tattva**) is inseparable from Śiva; it introduces the **vibration (spanda)** that will create the cosmos​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=%C5%9Aakti)
    
    . It is omnipotent activity (kriyā) and omniscient knowing (jnāna) in a latent state​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Another%20aspect%20of%20the%20Absolute,and%20%20164%20respectively)
    
    . **Śiva-Śakti together** form the basis of all lower tattvas.
- **Sadākhya (Sadāśiva)** – The first subtle manifestation (**abhāsa**) where the **individual “I” principle (aham)** appears​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=)
    
    . Here **Śiva and Śakti are in equilibrium**​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Also%20called%20Sad%C4%81%C5%9Biva%20%20tattva,the%20Absolute%20are%20in%20equilibrium)
    
    . The emphasis is on **Icchā** (divine will): the experience “_I am this_ (universe)” with the sense of _I_ still dominant​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=Manifestation%20starts%20with%20the%20Sadashiva,The)
    
    . Sadāśiva tattva represents **Absolute Sovereignty** – the cosmic **will** that begins creation​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=Manifestation%20starts%20with%20the%20Sadashiva,The)

    .
- **Īśvara** – The next phase where **Jñāna** (divine knowledge) is prominent. Now the experience tilts to “_This (universe) is myself_,” emphasizing the object “this”​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20Ishwara%20tattva,8)
    
    . Īśvara tattva corresponds to the divine act of **concealment** (tirodhāna) – the One conceals its unity to behold the diversity​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=)
    
    ​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20Ishwara%20tattva,8)
    
    . Here the seeds of separation appear as **God (Īśvara) and creation**.
- **Śuddha Vidyā** – Also called **Sadvidyā** or pure knowledge. This tattva is a state of balanced “I” and “this,” where self-awareness and object-awareness are equal​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=%C5%9Auddha%20Vidy%C4%81)
    
    . It represents the divine intellect that makes true knowledge possible. In Śuddha Vidyā, **creative activity and wisdom are balanced**, and the _Tri-mūrti_ (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra as creation, maintenance, destruction) emerge to carry out the cosmic functions​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=%C5%9Auddha%20Vidy%C4%81)
    
    . This tattva allows the soul’s identification with both the One and the many, serving as a bridge to lower realms.

_(Together, these five pure tattvas constitute the **Transcendental Unity**. They are the domain of Śiva’s grace and the means to moksha (liberation)​_

_[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=These%20five%20tattvas%20are%20the,its%20higher%20steps%20towards%20liberation)_

_.)_

**Seven Pure-Impure Tattvas (Śuddha-Aśuddha or **Vidya** Tattvas):** These are the “limited instruments” of the individual soul. They form the interface between the absolute and the empirical realm​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=ImageChart%20of%20the%2036%20tattvas,in%20Kashmir%20Shaivism)

. Here, the **One consciousness contracts** itself by self-imposed limitations. The _first is **Māyā tattva**_ – the cosmic illusion which makes the universal Self **appear as many**. **Māyā** veils the unity of Śiva, introducing fragmentation and difference​

[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)

. Under Māyā arise five constraining principles known as the **Kañcukas** (sheaths or cloaks)​

[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)

:

- **Kāla** – limitation in **Time**, causing the timeless Self to experience sequential time.
- **Niyati** – limitation in **Space/Order**, causing all-pervading consciousness to experience spatial order and causality (fixed destiny)​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)
    
    .
- **Rāga** – limitation in **Fullness**, introducing **desire/attachment**; the infinite bliss is obscured, leading to sense of lack and longing​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)
    
    .
- **Vidya** – limitation in **Knowledge**, so the omniscient Self now has finite knowledge (the individual intellect knows only partially)​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)
    
    .
- **Kalā** – limitation in **Power**, so the omnipotent Śakti is restricted to limited doership (the individual can only do some actions)​
    
    [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)
    
    .

Māyā and these five Kañcukas jointly **contract the infinite into the finite**. Through them, **Paramaśiva appears as countless individual souls**, each with bounded ability. The last tattva in this group is **Purusha** – the individual _Self_, or **limited experiencer**. Purusha is the soul bound by ignorance: a conscious being who perceives itself as separate. In Kashmir Shaivism, Purusha (Self) _plus_ the next tattva Prakṛti (Nature) correspond to the jīvātman in bondage. _Together, Māyā + 5 Kañcukas + Purusha are 7 tattvas (numbered 6–12)​_

_[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=experience%201,expression%2C%20handling%2C%20locomotion%2C%20discharge%2C%20resting)_

_._ They are “pure-impure” because they are **divine in essence** (arising from Śiva’s power) yet involve ignorance and limitation (**impurity**). They enable the **individualized experience** necessary for the soul’s journey​

[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=The%20magnificent%20Lord%20of%20Gauri,Abhinavagupta%2C%20Ishvarapratyabhijnavimarshini)

. (The soul’s tools of body, mind, senses emerge from these.)

**Twenty-Four Impure Tattvas (Aśuddha Tattvas):** These constitute the entire domain of **matter and mind** – the worldly existence experienced by the limited Purusha. They are “impure” because characterized by duality and unconscious matter. This set is essentially an elaboration of **Sāṅkhya’s 24 tattvas** (with slight differences in order), which Kashmir Shaivism fully incorporates​

[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=%E2%80%98ascent%E2%80%99%20%28lower%20to%20higher%29%20i,one%20reality%2C%20the%20consciousness%20is)

​

[philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/archive/TANCOM#:~:text=twenty,According%20to)

. They unfold as follows (tattvas 13–36):

- **Prakṛti** – Primordial Nature, the subtle matrix of matter. Prakṛti is the first evolute below Purusha​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Antahkarana%20is%20a%20collective%20term,evolve%20from%20ahamk%C4%81ra%20as%20it)
    
    . It is the **root of all insentient existence** – containing the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas) in equilibrium. From Prakṛti emerge all psychophysical constituents.
    
- **Buddhi** – Intellect or discriminative intelligence. The first evolute of Prakṛti, _Buddhi_ enables reasoning and decision-making​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Antahkarana%20is%20a%20collective%20term,evolve%20from%20ahamk%C4%81ra%20as%20it)
    
    . It gives the capacity to discern truth (but in the individual, it is limited understanding).
    
- **Ahaṁkāra** – Ego-principle. Evolves from Buddhi as the sense of **“I-maker”**, generating the notion of a separate self​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Intellect%20,tattvas%20that%20evolve%20from%20individual)
    
    . Ahaṁkāra divides the world into “I and mine” vs “other,” personalizing experience. From it arise the mind and sensory capacities as it further differentiates​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=represents%20the%20capacity%20of%20discernment,13)
    
    .
    
- **Manas** – Mind in the sense of **perceiving and processing**. It is the **thinking mind** that coordinates sensory data and formulates thoughts/desires​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Antahkarana%20is%20a%20collective%20term,evolve%20from%20ahamk%C4%81ra%20as%20it)
    
    . Manas is said to be the _indecisive_ aspect (collects impressions, whereas Buddhi makes judgments). Together, Buddhi, Ahaṁkāra, and Manas form the four-fold **Antaḥkaraṇa** (“inner instrument” of mind) along with **Citta** (memory). _Kashmir Shaivism sometimes counts Citta as included in Manas or Buddhi; the standard list here highlights the three main mental functions​

    ._
    
- **Five Jñānendriyas** – The five _sense organs_ or faculties of perception​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=)
    
    . These are capacities in consciousness corresponding to hearing (śrotra), touch (tvak), sight (cakṣus), taste (rasana), and smell (ghrāṇa)​

    . They enable the Purusha to gain knowledge of the external world (the _most sattvic_ functions of Manas, aligned with awareness)​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=The%20five%20sense%20organs%20,functions%20of%20manas%20and%20include)
    
    . _(Note: These are the subtle faculties, not the physical organs themselves.)_
    
- **Five Karmendriyas** – The five _organs of action_, i.e. faculties of expression/action​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Five%20motor%20organs)
    
    . They are speaking (vāk), grasping (pāṇi or hands), moving (pāda or locomotion via feet), excretion (pāyu) and reproduction (upastha)​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=The%20five%20motor%20organs%20,most%20rajasic%20functions%20of%20manas)
    
    . These represent the active output of the being (the _rajasic_ functions of mind, driving activity)​

    . Through these faculties, the Purusha interacts with and affects the world.
    
- **Five Tanmātras** – The five _subtle elements_ or subtle sense-objects​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Five%20subtle%20elements)
    
    . These are the essences of sensation: _śabda_ (sound), _sparśa_ (touch), _rūpa_ (form/color), _rasa_ (taste), _gandha_ (scent)​

    . They are the primordial subtle tattvas that underlie gross sensory phenomena. Tanmātras are the _tamasic_ (inert) aspects of mind, being just abstract qualities, and serve as seeds for the gross elements​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=)
    
    ​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Five%20gross%20elements)
    
    . They link consciousness to physical matter by providing the templates of sensory experience.
    
- **Five Mahābhūtas** – The five _gross elements_: **ākāśa** (ether/space), **vāyu** (air), **tejas** (fire), **jala** (water), **pṛthvī** (earth)​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=Main%20article%3A%20Panchabhuta)
    
    . These are the familiar physical elements that compose the material world and the gross body. They evolve from the tanmātras (each gross element corresponds to one subtle element) as the final solidification of consciousness into matter​

All 24 impure tattvas are essentially **products of Ahaṁkāra as it differentiates under the influence of the guṇas**​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=represents%20the%20capacity%20of%20discernment,13)

. From egoism in _sattva mode_ arise the mind and senses; in _rajas mode_ the action faculties; in _tamas mode_ the subtle and gross elements​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattva_\(Shaivism\)#:~:text=represents%20the%20capacity%20of%20discernment,13)

. Thus the entire panorama of experience – intellect, ego, mind, senses, body and external world – is a manifestation of the one **Universal Consciousness (Paramashiva)** in gradually diminishing intensity. Kashmir Shaiva texts emphasize that _each lower tattva contains a concealed presence of the higher ones_, and ultimately **all thirty-six tattvas reside in Śiva** as potentials​

. The process of **creation (descent)** is the Lord’s play of self-concealment, while spiritual **liberation (ascent)** involves reversing this process – recognizing the unity behind the tattvas and reabsorbing them into the Supreme​

. The hierarchy is therefore also a ladder of yoga: by transcending the impure tattvas of mind and matter, then the limitations of Māyā and the Kañcukas, the yogi “re-recognizes” (_pratyabhijñā_) their identity with Śiva, the Pure Consciousness that is the source of all. **In summary, the 36 tattvas form a coherent theoretical framework** explaining how the Absolute appears as the relative; each tattva has a distinct role – from the subtlest vibrations of divine will down to tangible matter – in the **structure of reality** as understood in Kashmir Shaivism​
