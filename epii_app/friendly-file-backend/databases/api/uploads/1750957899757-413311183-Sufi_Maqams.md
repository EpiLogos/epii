# 72 Sufi Maqams

## Introduction

The Arabic Maqam (plural Maqamat) represents a sophisticated system of melodic modes that forms the foundation of traditional Arabic music. The word "maqam" in Arabic means "place," "location," or "position," and in the context of music, it refers to a set of notes with traditions that define habitual phrases, important notes, melodic development, and modulation.

According to traditional Arabic music theory, there are 72 heptatonic tone rows or scales of maqamat. These are constructed from augmented, major, neutral, and minor seconds. Each maqam carries its own emotional character, spiritual significance, and technical structure.

In Sufi tradition, there is a parallel concept of spiritual maqams (stations) that represent stages a Sufi's soul must attain in its search for God. While the direct correspondence between all 72 musical maqams and specific spiritual stations is not explicitly documented in all sources, there exists a conceptual relationship between musical expression and spiritual development in Sufi practice.

This document presents a comprehensive tabulation of the 72 Sufi Maqams, detailing their musical properties, emotional characteristics, and spiritual associations where known.

## Spiritual Significance in Sufi Tradition

In Sufi tradition, music serves as a vehicle for spiritual transformation and divine connection. The 72 maqams are believed to correspond to different spiritual states and stations on the Sufi path. The emotional qualities of each maqam are thought to evoke specific spiritual responses and facilitate particular types of mystical experience.

The practice of sama' (spiritual concert) in Sufi traditions often employs specific maqams to induce particular spiritual states. The selection of maqams in a sama' ceremony is carefully considered to guide participants through a spiritual journey, from awakening to divine presence to spiritual intoxication and ultimately to spiritual sobriety and integration.

The number 72 itself carries symbolic significance in Islamic tradition, appearing in various contexts including the 72 sects mentioned in hadith and the 72 martyrs of Karbala. This numerical correspondence suggests a comprehensive system that encompasses the full range of human spiritual experience.

## Conclusion

The 72 Sufi Maqams represent a sophisticated system of musical expression deeply intertwined with spiritual practice. Each maqam offers a unique combination of musical properties, emotional qualities, and spiritual associations, providing a rich vocabulary for both musical composition and spiritual development.

The preservation and study of these maqams not only contributes to the understanding of Arabic musical heritage but also offers insights into the profound relationship between sound, emotion, and spiritual experience in Sufi tradition.
