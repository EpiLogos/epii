# Conceptual Alignment Brief: {Development Name} ({PhilosophicalLayer})

**Context:** This brief outlines the initial conceptual alignment for the **{Development Name}** initiative, operating within the **{currentSubsystem}** (as set by the Orchestrator) and targeting its specific development goals. It serves as the starting point for the Epi-Logos Feature Definer. All artifacts related to this brief, including this document itself, are to be stored in the development-specific directory: `epi-logos-memory-root` + `currentSubsystem` + `/Developments/` + `currentDevelopmentName` + `/docs/` (e.g., `{epi-logos-memory-root}/4_Nara/Developments/Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1/docs/conceptual_alignment_brief.md`).

## Introduction / Problem Statement (from an Epi-Logos Perspective)

{Describe the core idea, the problem being solved, or the opportunity being addressed for this specific **{DevelopmentName}**. Why is this development needed in the context of Epi-Logos? Consider linking to relevant sections in `{epi-logos-memory-root}/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/` or the parent {Project Name} brief if this is a sub-development. This section should reflect insights from the "Conceptual Alignment & Ideation Phase" and/or the "Memory-bank Exploration Directive Phase".}

## Vision & Goals (for this Development, aligned with Epi-Logos)

- **Vision:** {Describe the high-level desired future state or impact of this specific **{DevelopmentName}**, and how it contributes to the overall Epi-Logos vision and the specific goals of its **{Subsystem}**.}
- **Primary Goals (Conceptual):** {List 2-5 specific conceptual goals for **{DevelopmentName}** that align with Epi-Logos principles.}
  - Goal 1: ...
  - Goal 2: ...
- **Success Metrics (Qualitative & Philosophical):** {How will we measure if **{DevelopmentName}** is successful from an Epi-Logos perspective? List potential qualitative indicators or philosophical alignments.}

## Target Audience / Users (as Participants in Epi-Logos)

{Describe the primary users of this system/feature within **{DevelopmentName}**. Who are they in the context of Epi-Logos (e.g., seekers, explorers, contributors to the memory-bank)? What are their key characteristics or needs relevant to this **{DevelopmentName}** and its role within the **{Subsystem}**?}

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Conceptual Ideas for {Development Name})

{List the core functionalities or features envisioned for **{DevelopmentName}** from a conceptual, Epi-Logos aligned perspective. Keep this high-level; details will be fleshed out by the Epi-Logos Feature Definer in the EFDD. These ideas should stem from the "Conceptual Alignment Insights".}

- Conceptual Idea 1: ...
- Conceptual Idea 2: ...
- Conceptual Idea N: ...

## Post MVP Conceptual Ideas (for {Development Name})

{List potential future concepts or expansions for **{DevelopmentName}** that align with the Epi-Logos trajectory for its **{Subsystem}**.}

- Future Concept 1: ...
- Future Concept N: ...

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences (from an Epi-Logos Viewpoint)

- **Constraints:** {List any known limitations, technical mandates, or preferences for **{DevelopmentName}** that are guided by Epi-Logos principles (e.g., use of specific technologies that align with Sacred Technology Ethos, integration requirements with existing Bimba-coordinated `{Subsystem}` components).}
- **Initial Architectural Preferences (if any, Epi-Logos Aligned):** {Capture any early thoughts regarding repository structure or service architecture for **{DevelopmentName}** that would best support Epi-Logos principles. This is not a final decision point.}
- **Adherence to Epi-Logos Principles:** All development for **{DevelopmentName}** must adhere to established Epi-Logos architectural principles (e.g., `{epi-logos-memory-root}/Epi-Logos System (Technology)/System_Design_Principles.md`) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) where applicable.
- **Risks (Philosophical & Technical):** {Identify potential risks for **{DevelopmentName}** â€“ e.g., challenges in aligning with specific philosophical tenets, technical hurdles in implementing Epi-Logos resonant features, dependencies on other `{Subsystem}` developments.}

## Relevant Research / Memory Exploration Insights (for {Development Name})

{Link to or summarize findings from the "Conceptual Alignment & Ideation Phase" (`conceptual_alignment_insights.md`) and/or the "Memory-bank Exploration Directive Phase" (`memory_bank_exploration_directive.md`) conducted for **{DevelopmentName}**. These are expected to be in the development-specific directory: `epi-logos-memory-root` + `currentSubsystem` + `/Developments/` + `currentDevelopmentName` + `/docs/` (or a subfolder like `/0_conceptual_alignment/` within `docs`).}

## Handoff Prompt to Epi-Logos Feature Definer

This Conceptual Alignment Brief provides the full context for the **{Development Name}** development run, operating within the **{currentSubsystem}**. Please start in 'Feature Definition Mode', review this brief thoroughly to work with the user to create the "Epi-Logos Feature Definition Document (EFDD)" section by section, one at a time. Ask for any necessary clarification or suggest improvements aligned with your persona. The EFDD will be stored in the development-specific directory: `epi-logos-memory-root` + `currentSubsystem` + `/Developments/` + `currentDevelopmentName` + `/docs/efdd.md` (or within a `/1_feature_definition/` subfolder in `docs`).
