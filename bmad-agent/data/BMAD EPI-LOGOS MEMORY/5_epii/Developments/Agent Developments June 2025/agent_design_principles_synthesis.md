# Agent Development Principles: Synthesis from Research

This document synthesizes key principles for building effective and reliable AI agents, based on articles from Cognition AI and Anthropic.

## 1. Core Architectural Principle: Single, Linear Agent > Multi-Agent

The most critical takeaway is the argument against multi-agent architectures for most tasks. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>

*   **Problem with Multi-Agent:** When a task is broken down and given to separate, parallel "sub-agents," they lose the shared context of the original request and the ongoing work of other agents. This leads to miscommunication, conflicting decisions (e.g., inconsistent visual styles), and compounding errors that are difficult to integrate back into a coherent whole. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>
*   **Solution: Single-Threaded Architecture:** The most reliable agent architecture is a single, linear process that works on tasks and sub-tasks sequentially. This ensures the agent's context is continuous and complete at every step, preventing drift and maintaining coherence. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>

## 2. The Importance of Context Engineering

"Context Engineering" is the practice of dynamically and automatically providing an agent with the necessary information to perform its job. It is considered the #1 task for engineers building agentic systems. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>

*   **Principle 1: Share full agent traces, not just individual messages.** An agent needs the complete history—including previous turns, tool calls, and results—to understand the nuances of a task. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>
*   **Principle 2: Actions carry implicit decisions.** A tool call is not just an action; it's a decision based on assumptions. If agents cannot see each other's actions, they will make conflicting implicit decisions, leading to poor outcomes. <mcreference link="https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents#principles-of-context-engineering" index="0">0</mcreference>

## 3. Building Blocks and Patterns

The Anthropic article provides a practical guide to building agentic systems, emphasizing simplicity and composability. <mcreference link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents" index="1">1</mcreference>

*   **Start Simple:** Begin by using LLM APIs directly. Avoid complex frameworks that add layers of abstraction and can make debugging difficult. Add complexity only when required. <mcreference link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents" index="1">1</mcreference>
*   **Workflows vs. Agents:**
    *   **Workflows:** Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. They are predictable and good for well-defined tasks. <mcreference link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents" index="1">1</mcreference>
    *   **Agents:** Systems where the LLM dynamically directs its own process and tool usage. They are flexible and better for complex, open-ended tasks. <mcreference link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents" index="1">1</mcreference>
*   **Composable Patterns:**
    *   **Augmented LLM:** The foundational block is an LLM with access to tools, memory, and retrieval.
    *   **Prompt Chaining:** Decomposing a task into a sequence of LLM calls, where each step processes the output of the previous one. This trades latency for higher accuracy. <mcreference link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Conclusion for Epi-Logos

The ideal architecture is a **single, orchestrating agent** that maintains a full context trace. This agent should operate by executing **composable workflows** (dynamic chains of tools/skills) to accomplish complex tasks. This approach combines the reliability of a single-threaded model with the flexibility of dynamic, agent-led decision-making.
