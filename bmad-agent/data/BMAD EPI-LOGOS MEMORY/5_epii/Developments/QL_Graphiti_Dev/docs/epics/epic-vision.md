# Vision & Goal

To evolve the Graphiti episodic memory system from a repository of simple entities and relations into a sophisticated engine for conceptual synthesis. This will be achieved by enabling Graphiti to identify, model, and refine holistic epistemic structures based on the foundational 4-part and 6-part variants of Quaternal Logic.

The primary goal is to create a high-level layer of refined, structured memory (`epistemic wholes`). This will empower the agent to perform deeper reasoning and generate insights by operating on these complete conceptual units, thereby reducing the cognitive load and context-dependency of the `UnifiedRag` process for many interactions.
