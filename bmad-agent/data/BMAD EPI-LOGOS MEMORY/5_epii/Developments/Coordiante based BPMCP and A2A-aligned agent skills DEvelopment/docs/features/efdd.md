# Epi-Logos - Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Context:** This PRD outlines the requirements for the **Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment** initiative, a specific feature/component/subsystem enhancement within the broader **Epi-Logos (5_epii)** context. All artifacts related to this PRD are stored in `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/5_epii/Developments/Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment/`. The primary output of this PRD process will be an Epi-Logos Feature Definition Document (EFDD) located at `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/5_epii/Developments/Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment/docs/features/efdd.md`.

## Goal, Objective and Context (for Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment)

The Epi-Logos system, through its Bimba-Pratibimba Memory-MCP (BPMCP) and the Epii agent analysis pipeline, already possesses significant capabilities for document processing, coordinate-based alignment, and multi-modal RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). This development initiative focuses on the strategic refinement, integration, and operationalization of these existing capabilities to create a highly coherent and potent RAG-enabled ecosystem for A2A-aligned agent skill development.

**Core Needs & Objectives:**
1.  **Refine/Update/Create BPMCP Tools for Unified Coordinate-Based Retrieval:** Enhance BPMCP's toolkit to seamlessly query across Neo4j graph RAG, LightRAG vector search, MongoDB document fetching, and Notion page content using Bimba coordinates. This includes a thorough audit and alignment of data structures and schemas.
2.  **Evolve the Epii Analysis Pipeline:** Ensure the pipeline dynamically leverages enhanced BPMCP RAG tools, consuming RAG-derived insights to enrich its analysis processes and produce RAG-optimized outputs, fostering an evolutionary feedback loop.
3.  **Systematic Knowledge Population & A2A Skill Development:** Populate the system with pre-prepared, coordinate-aligned documents to serve as a foundation for defining, developing, and testing A2A-aligned agent skills, particularly those aligned with the Epii agent's coordinate branch (e.g., #5).
4.  **Continuous Testing & Iteration:** Constantly test enhanced BPMCP RAG capabilities in practical contexts to drive iterative refinement of tools and the knowledge base.

**Vision:** To evolve BPMCP into an intelligent, RAG-powered knowledge hub that seamlessly integrates insights from all coordinate-aligned documentation, making comprehensive and context-aware information readily available. This will drive more efficient development processes and pioneer a "meta-techne" loop, where the system's operational data and analytical outputs feedback into its development, creating a self-improving technological praxis.

**Overall Goals:**
1.  Refine BPMCP for Multi-Modal RAG with robust data/metadata schema alignment.
2.  Evolve Epii Analysis Pipeline to integrate and leverage BPMCP RAG tools for evolutionary analysis.
3.  Develop A2A-Aligned Agent Skills (focusing on Epii domain coordinates #5-0, #5-1, #5-5 and #5-2, #5-3, #5-4) using enhanced RAG.
4.  Establish Dynamic BPMCP Tool Workflows and explore inter-agent communication.
5.  Enable Advanced Knowledge Synthesis across Notion pages (e.g., via Perplexity API).
6.  Systematically Populate Knowledge and continuously test RAG capabilities.

-   **UIDG1: Clear and Consistent API Design:**
    -   All new or updated BPMCP tools (FR1.4) MUST have a consistent API signature, particularly for coordinate-based querying.
    -   Input parameters (especially Bimba coordinates) and output structures (RAG results) should be standardized and well-defined.

## Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP (for Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment)

These are features and capabilities that are valuable but are not planned for the initial MVP of the "Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment" initiative. They may be considered for future iterations.

-   **OOS1: Full Dynamic Orchestration of BPMCP Tools by Epii:** While basic workflows are in scope (FR4), a fully dynamic, AI-driven orchestration of BPMCP tools by the Epii agent, where it autonomously decides which tools to call in what sequence based on complex reasoning, is post-MVP. The MVP will focus on more pre-defined or simpler scripted workflows.
-   **OOS2: Advanced Inter-Agent Communication Protocols:** While basic data passing (FR4.2) and agent invocation of workflows (FR4.3 exploration) are touched upon, the development of sophisticated, robust, and standardized inter-agent communication protocols for complex collaborative tasks using the RAG system is a larger effort for post-MVP.
-   **OOS3: Proactive Knowledge Gap Identification by Epii:** The Epii pipeline identifying gaps in the knowledge base (via RAG results or lack thereof) and automatically suggesting areas for new knowledge population or refinement is a highly advanced feature for future consideration.
-   **OOS4: Automated Generation of A2A Agent Skills:** While the MVP provides a foundation for A2A skill development (FR3), the automated *generation* of agent skill definitions or code based on high-level requirements or observed patterns is post-MVP.
-   **OOS5: Sophisticated Feedback Mechanisms from Epii to RAG:** While FR2.4 suggests exploring feedback, a comprehensive system where Epii provides detailed, structured feedback to the RAG system to automatically fine-tune retrieval strategies or re-rank results is post-MVP.
-   **OOS6: User-Facing UI for RAG Configuration and Testing:** The current MVP focuses on developer/agent-facing APIs. A dedicated graphical user interface for business users or less technical analysts to configure RAG sources, run test queries, or explore knowledge is out of scope for this MVP.
-   **OOS7: Full-Scale Deployment and Optimization for Production Loads:** The MVP focuses on development and initial testing. Optimizations for high-concurrency, large-scale production loads, and enterprise-grade monitoring and alerting are post-MVP considerations.
-   **OOS8: Advanced Semantic Search and Reasoning Capabilities beyond current RAG:** Incorporating more advanced AI reasoning layers on top of RAG outputs, such as complex logical inference or causal reasoning, is beyond the current scope which focuses on robust retrieval and basic synthesis.
-   **OOS9: Multi-lingual Support for RAG:** The current MVP assumes English as the primary language for documents and queries. Adding robust support for multiple languages in the RAG pipeline is a post-MVP enhancement.
