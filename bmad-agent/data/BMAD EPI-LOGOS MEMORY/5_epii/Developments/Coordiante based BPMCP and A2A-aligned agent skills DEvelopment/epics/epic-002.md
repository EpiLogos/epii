### EPIC-002: A2A Skill Management Framework with Graphiti-Powered Dynamic Contextualization

*   **Description:** Develop a comprehensive framework for defining, registering, discovering, and invoking A2A-aligned agent skills. This framework will deeply integrate the **Graphiti service** (planned to run as a dedicated Python-based service, potentially an MCP server) for dynamic contextualization, incorporating awareness of user interactions (chat, UI canvas selections, **communicated via the AG-UI protocol**) and the agent's current analytical focus. Skill definitions will include input/output schemas, BPMCP tool utilization, Bimba coordinate associations, and explicit links to Graphiti entities/types. This allows skills to leverage **document-level memory and structural Bimba knowledge represented within the Graphiti service, always anchored by Bimba coordinates.** Enhancements to the `Skills Registry` and `Skills Router` will manage skill lifecycle and context-aware invocation. **The framework will align with the 6-subsystem backend architecture, with the Graphiti service serving as a key contextual layer for skill operations.**
*   **Goal:** To establish a robust foundation for creating and managing reusable agent capabilities that are discoverable and executable within Bimba coordinate and rich Graphiti context (including real-time user interactions via **AG-UI** and refined analytical insights from the **Graphiti service**). This ensures skills adapt to evolving information, **streamline their own context windows for execution,** and can effectively **inform or trigger updates to Notion or Bimba, maintaining Bimba coordinate integrity.**
*   **Potential High-Level User Stories (Developer/System Perspective - Updated for Graphiti Service, AG-UI & New Focus Areas):**
    *   "As a Developer, I want to define an agent skill with clear inputs/outputs, Bimba coordinate applicability, and linkage to Graphiti entities/types (reflecting document insights, Bimba structure, and UI states **from AG-UI via the Graphiti service**), so it can be dynamically contextualized and registered."
    *   "As the System, I want agents to query the Skills Registry for skills relevant to a task, Bimba coordinate, and dynamic conditions in the **Graphiti service** (including user's current chat/canvas focus **from AG-UI** and derived document-level memory), to enable **refined skill selection.**"
    *   "As the Skills Router, I want to invoke a skill, passing context from Bimba and the **Graphiti service** (including relevant Bimba structural knowledge, document memory snippets, and UI interaction data **from AG-UI**), to ensure precise execution and **optimized context for the skill itself.**"
*   **Relevant FCBAP Sections:** 3.2.2 A2A-Aligned Agent Skills, parts of 3.2.4 Bimba Coordinate Integration, and new considerations for UI-contextualized skill invocation (via **AG-UI**), the **Graphiti service** as a central memory hub for skills, and its operation as a potential MCP server.
