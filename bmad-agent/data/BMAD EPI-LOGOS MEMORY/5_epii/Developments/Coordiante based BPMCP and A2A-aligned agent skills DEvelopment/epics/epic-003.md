### EPIC-003: Epii Agent Enhancement for Advanced Skill Execution & Orchestration with Graphiti-Powered Intelligence

*   **Description:** Enhance the Epii Agent's core logic to masterfully utilize the A2A Skill Management Framework (EPIC-002). This involves improving its ability to decompose tasks by leveraging the **Graphiti service** (planned as a dedicated Python-based service, potentially an MCP server) for dynamic context (including user chat/canvas interactions **via AG-UI protocol** and refined analytical insights). The agent will discover skills using Bimba coordinates and rich Graphiti context (which holds document-level memory and Bimba structural knowledge, **all grounded by Bimba coordinates**), invoke them with precise dynamic context, and manage information flow. The agent's interaction with the Epii Analysis Pipeline (QL stages) will be skill-based, using the **Graphiti service** to manage state. **This enhancement aligns with the 6-subsystem backend architecture, where the Graphiti service acts as a central nervous system for the agent's orchestration logic, crucial for streamlining context windows for both the agent and invoked skills.**
*   **Covered FRs:** FR6, and new requirements for advanced orchestration, UI-contextualized skill sequencing (via **AG-UI**), Graphiti service integration, and pipeline interaction via skills within the new backend architecture.
*   **Goal:** Empower the Epii Agent with sophisticated orchestration, enabling complex, multi-step tasks by dynamically leveraging A2A skills. The **Graphiti service's** role as a dynamic, unified memory (capturing user state via **AG-UI**, document insights, Bimba knowledge) is central, providing real-time awareness for intelligent decision-making, adaptive execution, and **informing potential Notion or Bimba updates, always maintaining Bimba coordinate integrity.** This is critical for autonomous, contextually-aware agent behavior and **efficient context utilization.**
*   **Potential High-Level User Stories (Agent/System Perspective - Updated for Graphiti Service, AG-UI & New Focus Areas):**
    *   "As an Epii Agent, given a complex task, I want to consult the **Graphiti service** for relevant entities, relationships, and current user interaction context (from **AG-UI**) tied to my Bimba coordinate, then decompose the task into a sequence of skills by querying the Skills Registry, **ensuring refined analysis informs skill choice.**"
    *   "As an Epii Agent, when invoking a skill, I want to provide it with dynamic context from the **Graphiti service** (specific entities, user's focus via **AG-UI**, document-level memory snippets, relevant Bimba structural data) and my Bimba coordinate, **optimizing the skill's context window for effective execution, potentially for Notion/Bimba updates.**"
    *   "As an Epii Agent, I want to trigger Epii Analysis Pipeline stages as skills, or consume their outputs via skills, using the **Graphiti service** to manage state and context (including insights that could refine Bimba or document understanding stored in Graphiti, **all linked to Bimba coordinates**), integrating deep analysis with skill-based actions seamlessly."
