# Story 2.1: Define Agent Skill Structure and Registration Process

**Context:** Part of Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment (5_epii / Developments)
**Location:** `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/5_epii/Developments/Coordiante based BPMCP and A2A-aligned agent skills DEvelopment/stories/story-2.1.md`

## Status: Approved

## Story

- **As a** Developer (within the **6-subsystem architecture** context),
- **I want** to define an agent skill with inputs, outputs, Bimba coordinate applicability, and linkage to Graphiti entities/types, **considering UI context (chat/canvas selections)** for dynamic contextualization and **leveraging document-level memory/Bimba structure from Graphiti,**
- **So that** it can be registered, enabling **refined analysis for skill execution,** **streamlined context for invocation,** and **informing potential Notion/Bimba updates.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Standardized skill definition schema (JSON/YAML) is established, reflecting the **6-subsystem architecture's** needs.
2.  Schema includes: name, description, version, I/O params, Bimba coordinate patterns, Graphiti entity/type patterns (for dynamic context, **including UI context markers like chat/canvas selections**), and BPMCP tool to execute, explicitly supporting **document-level memory and Bimba structural knowledge from Graphiti.**
3.  Skill registration process/API (within the **6-subsystem architecture**) is available.
4.  Skills Registry validates definitions against schema.
5.  Registered skills are persistently stored and retrievable.
6.  Documentation covers skill definition, registration, and how **UI context** influences applicability and parameterization, **streamlining context for invocation.**
7.  Skill definitions consider how their execution might **inform Notion/Bimba updates.**
8.  The definition supports **refined analysis for skill execution** by allowing detailed contextual prerequisites.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design the skill definition schema (AC: #1, #2)
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Research existing skill/function definition standards for inspiration.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Define fields for metadata, input/output, Bimba applicability, **Graphiti entity/type applicability**, and execution details.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Choose a format (JSON/YAML) and document the schema.
- [ ] Task 2: Develop the Skill Registration mechanism (AC: #3)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Design API endpoint(s) for skill registration (e.g., POST /skills).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement the logic to receive and process skill definitions.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement schema validation for skill registration (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 4: Implement persistent storage for registered skills in the Skills Registry (AC: #5)
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Choose a suitable database/storage mechanism for the Skills Registry.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement save and retrieve functions.
- [ ] Task 5: Create developer documentation for skill definition and registration (AC: #6)

## Dev Technical Guidance

-   This story lays the foundation for the A2A Skill Framework.
-   The Skills Registry will be a critical component of the BPMCP.
-   Refer to `../../docs/architecture_shards/bpmcp-architecture-overview.md#skills-registry` for its role.
-   The skill definition schema should be flexible yet robust.
-   Consider using a schema validation library (e.g., JSON Schema validator).
-   For Bimba coordinate applicability, define a clear pattern matching or specificity logic (e.g., wildcards, hierarchical matching). Similarly, for Graphiti applicability, define how skills can be linked to specific entity types, instances, or patterns within Graphiti to enable dynamic, context-aware skill discovery.
-   The `A2A_Skill_Framework_Design.md` shard (if it exists) would be highly relevant.
-   Ensure the registration process is secure if it involves external API calls.
