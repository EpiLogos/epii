### 4. Bimba Alignment

This feature directly supports and enhances the Bimba-centric architecture of the Epi-Logos system.

*   **Coordinate as First-Class Citizen:** Bimba coordinates are integral to skill definition, discovery, invocation, and data tagging. This ensures that agent actions are always grounded in the multi-dimensional context provided by Bimba.
*   **Enhancing #5-4 "Siva-Shakti" (A2A Communication Layer):**
    *   The proposed A2A-aligned skills and their registration/routing mechanism directly build upon and utilize the `friendly-file-back2front` A2A layer.
    *   By standardizing skill definitions and making them discoverable via coordinates, we enhance the system's ability for agents to coordinate and collaborate effectively.
*   **Supporting #5-3 "Prakriti-Purusha" (Epii Analysis Pipeline):**
    *   Agents leveraging the new skills can consume outputs from the pipeline (e.g., RAG results from Stage -3) and use Bimba coordinates to contextualize this information further.
    *   The ability to dynamically orchestrate BPMCP tools based on coordinates allows for more flexible and targeted post-processing of pipeline results.
*   **Alignment with #5-2 "Maya-Brahman" (BPMCP):**
    *   This feature makes BPMCP tools more accessible and intelligently utilized by agents.
    *   Instead of direct, potentially complex tool integrations, agents interact with higher-level skills that abstract tool usage, guided by Bimba coordinates.
*   **Data Provenance and Contextualization:** Tagging all data and agent actions with Bimba coordinates strengthens data provenance and allows for a richer contextual understanding of information flow within the system.
