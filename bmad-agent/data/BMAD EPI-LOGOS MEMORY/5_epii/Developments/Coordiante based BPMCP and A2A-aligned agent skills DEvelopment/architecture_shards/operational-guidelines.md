### 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) Considerations

*   **Performance:**
    *   Skill discovery and invocation should be efficient to minimize latency in agent responses.
    *   BPMCP tool execution time will be a factor; skills should be designed to use tools judiciously.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   The skills registry and router must be robust.
    *   Error handling within skills and agent logic is crucial.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   The system should be able to handle an increasing number of agents, skills, and BPMCP tools.
    *   The A2A layer's scalability will be a dependency.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   Skills should be well-defined, modular, and testable.
    *   Clear documentation for skill creation and registration.
*   **Security:**
    *   Access control for skill invocation (if necessary, though current A2A model might rely on network-level security).
    *   Secure handling of data passed between agents, skills, and tools.
*   **Testability:**
    *   Individual skills should be unit-testable.
    *   Integration tests for agent-skill-tool interactions will be necessary.
