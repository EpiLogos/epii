### 3. Proposed Architectural Solution

This section details the proposed architecture for enabling coordinate-based BPMCP tool orchestration and A2A-aligned agent skills.

### 3.1. Core Architectural Principles

*   **Agent-Centric Design:** Intelligent agents are the primary actors, making decisions about tool usage and skill invocation.
*   **Skill-Based Capabilities:** Agent functionalities are exposed as discrete, discoverable, and invocable "skills."
*   **Coordinate-Driven Context:** Bimba coordinates provide the necessary spatial, semantic, and contextual information for agents to operate effectively.
*   **Decoupled Components:** Agents, skills, BPMCP tools, and the A2A layer should be loosely coupled to promote modularity and maintainability.

### 3.2. Key Components and Interactions

**(Diagram to be developed in a future iteration - conceptual flow described below)**

1.  **Intelligent Agent Focus: Epii Agent (Enhanced):**
    *   The primary agent for this development will be the existing **Epii agent**. Its capabilities will be enhanced to incorporate the new functionalities for coordinate-based BPMCP orchestration and A2A-aligned skills.
    *   The Epii agent will possess the logic to understand task requirements (potentially derived from user input or other system triggers within its operational domain).
    *   It will query the `Skills Registry` to discover available skills relevant to the task and current Bimba coordinate context.
    *   Based on discovered skills and internal logic, it will select and sequence BPMCP tools.
    *   It will interact with the A2A layer to communicate with other agents or report status.
    *   **Location of Enhancements:** Primarily within the existing Epii agent's codebase, likely in `epii_app/friendly-file-backend/agents/epiiAgent.js` (or equivalent) and its associated skill definitions in `friendly-file-back2front/agent-cards/epii-agent-card.js` and `friendly-file-back2front/skills/epii-skills-initializer.js`.
    *   **Consideration for Sub-Agents:** While the initial approach is to enhance the Epii agent, if specific functionalities emerge that are highly distinct, require a separate lifecycle, or would make the Epii agent overly complex, the creation of specialized sub-agents (coordinated by the Epii agent or operating peer-to-peer via A2A) will be considered. However, the preference is for simplicity by augmenting the existing agent first.

2.  **A2A-Aligned Agent Skills:**
    *   **Definition:** Skills will be defined as specific, invokable functions or modules that encapsulate a particular capability (e.g., "retrieve documents from Qdrant based on semantic query and Bimba coordinates," "summarize text using specific BPMCP tool").
    *   **Structure:** Each skill will have a defined input/output schema, specify the BPMCP tools it utilizes, and be associated with relevant Bimba coordinates (indicating its operational domain or the type of context it expects).
    *   **Registration (`agent-cards/` & `skills/` in `friendly-file-back2front`):
        *   Skills will be advertised in the respective `agent-card.js` (e.g., `epii-agent-card.js`).
        *   They will be registered in `bimba-skills-registry.js`, mapping the skill to its implementation and relevant Bimba coordinates.
        *   Initialization might occur in files like `epii-skills-initializer.js`.
    *   **Invocation:** Agents will invoke skills through the `bimba-skills-router.js`, which will handle locating and executing the skill based on the A2A message and coordinate context.

3.  **Dynamic BPMCP Tool Orchestration Logic (within Agents/Skills):
    *   Agents/Skills will contain the logic to dynamically select BPMCP tools.
    *   This selection will be based on the task, the current Bimba coordinate context, and the specific parameters of the skill being executed.
    *   Example: A "knowledge retrieval" skill might first use a BPMCP tool to query Neo4j for relevant nodes (Bimba coordinates), then use another BPMCP tool to fetch document chunks from Qdrant based on those coordinates, and finally a tool to summarize the results.

4.  **Bimba Coordinate Integration:**
    *   **Contextualization:** Agents will receive and operate within Bimba coordinate contexts.
    *   **Skill Matching:** The `Skills Registry` and `Router` will use Bimba coordinates to match tasks/requests to appropriate skills.
    *   **Data Tagging:** Data processed and generated by agents/skills will be tagged with relevant Bimba coordinates.
    *   **Tool Parameterization:** BPMCP tool calls will often include Bimba coordinates as parameters (e.g., to scope a search in Qdrant or Neo4j).

5.  **Interaction with Epii Analysis Pipeline:**
    *   **Consuming Pipeline Output:** Agents can be designed to act upon the structured output of the Epii Analysis Pipeline (e.g., identified patterns, semantic mappings from Stage -2, or RAG results from Stage -3).
    *   **Triggering Pipeline Stages:** Agents could potentially initiate or provide input to specific stages of the pipeline as part of a broader workflow.
    *   **Leveraging Stage -3 (RAG):** New agent skills can be designed to directly leverage the existing RAG capabilities within Stage -3, perhaps by formatting queries for it or processing its outputs in novel ways.

### 3.3. Data Flow and Control Flow (Conceptual)

*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  A task is initiated (e.g., via user request, A2A message from another agent).
    2.  The relevant agent receives the task, including Bimba coordinate context.
    3.  Agent queries `Skills Registry` via A2A for suitable skills based on task and coordinates.
    4.  Agent selects a skill and invokes it via the `Skills Router`.
    5.  The skill executes, potentially calling multiple BPMCP tools in sequence.
    6.  BPMCP tools interact with underlying data stores (Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.).
    7.  Results are returned to the skill, then to the agent.
    8.  The agent processes results, potentially performs synthesis, and may invoke further skills or report completion/output via A2A.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Input data (queries, documents, Bimba coordinates) flows into agents/skills.
    2.  Data is passed to BPMCP tools as parameters.
    3.  BPMCP tools retrieve/generate data from/to databases.
    4.  Output data from tools flows back to skills/agents.
    5.  Synthesized knowledge, tagged with Bimba coordinates, is the final output.

### 3.4. Agent Decision Logic for Tool Selection

*   Initially, this logic might be rule-based or scripted within each skill's definition.
*   Future enhancements could involve more sophisticated AI-driven planning capabilities within agents to determine optimal tool sequences.
*   The `Skills Registry` itself could evolve to include metadata about skill prerequisites, effects, and costs, aiding agent decision-making.
