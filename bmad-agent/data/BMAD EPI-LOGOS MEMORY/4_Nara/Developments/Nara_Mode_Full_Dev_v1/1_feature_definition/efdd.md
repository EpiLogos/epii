# Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy) - Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Context:** This PRD outlines the requirements for the **Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1** initiative, a specific feature/component/subsystem enhancement within the broader **Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy) (Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)} - 4_Nara)** context. All artifacts related to this PRD are stored in `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/4_Nara/Developments/Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1/`. The primary output of this PRD process will be an Epi-Logos Feature Definition Document (EFDD) located at `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/4_Nara/Developments/Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1/1_feature_definition/efdd.md`.

## Goal, Objective and Context (for Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1)

The Nara Mode initiative aims to create a transformational digital experience, bridging ancient wisdom with modern AI. It focuses on a dia-logical, not purely transactional, system to facilitate deep psychological and spiritual work. The core problem is the lack of digital tools that genuinely support integrated spiritual development through symbolic interaction and personalized archetypal exploration. Nara Mode addresses this by offering a quaternary framework for symbolic integration across identity, oracular engagement, and journaling.

**Overall Vision:** To establish Nara Mode as a sophisticated spiritual companion that empowers users to develop symbolic literacy and transformational capacity through an evolving, coherent, and deeply personalized archetypal journey, manifesting as an embodied dia-logos through quaternary structural integration.

**Primary Goals (Conceptual):**
- Goal 1: To implement a quaternary logical framework (grounded in Mahamaya's implicit grounding, decanic embodiment, and tarot-alchemical crucible principles) governing user experience and backend agent coordination for a holistic transformational cycle.
- Goal 2: To create a dynamic, evolving archetypal map (Identity Dynamics) from multiple symbolic systems (Human Design, Gene Keys, astrology), deeply integrated with decanic wisdom and Mahamaya's codon architectures, serving as a foundation for all interactions.
- Goal 3: To enable active transformation (Oracle) through real-time synthesis of tarot, hermetic imagery, astrology, decanic associations, and psychological practices, providing coherent, personalized guidance within a "decanic theater" and advanced alchemical reading modes.
- Goal 4: To facilitate deep integration and synthesis (Journal) by using the BPMCP to identify symbolic patterns, alchemical operation opportunities, and dream imagery mapped to codon sequences, reflecting unconscious processes and fostering growth, with links to deeper philosophical exploration (Notion) and dynamic symbolic metabolism.
- Goal 5: To realize a "Concrescent Interface" with phase-locked progression across Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal, driven by a 12-fold concrescence rhythm and enabling bidirectional agent communion.
- Goal 6: To foster "Epi-Logos Emergence" through a meta-mediation layer, featuring dynamic symbolic metabolism in the Journal and a recursive, self-modifying interface design.

**Success Metrics (Qualitative & Philosophical):**
- Users report a deeper understanding of their archetypal patterns and symbolic language, including decanic and codon-level insights.
- Users experience meaningful insights and guidance through the enhanced Oracle function, including its alchemical and decanic dimensions.
- Users demonstrate increased symbolic literacy and integration of experiences through the advanced Journaling synthesis engine.
- The system maintains narrative coherence and phase-locked progression across the Identity, Oracle, and Journal sections, reflecting the concrescence rhythm.
- The platform successfully fosters a dia-logical relationship between the user and the Nara agent, supported by specialized backend agents.
- The interface dynamically reflects the user's journey and symbolic metabolism.
