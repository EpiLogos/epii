# Epic 4: Nara Agent Core & Coordination: The Orchestrating Intelligence

**Goal:** Develop the core Nara agent as the central orchestrating intelligence. Design based upon foundational leveraging of the BPMCP service, and implement AG-UI and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols to enable sophisticated real-time synthesis of symbolic data, ensuring coherent and contextually aware user experiences across all Nara functionalities (keeping in mind the future integration of other Epi-Logos agents).

**Core Concept:** The Nara agent acts as both a coordinator and synthesizer, mediating between the user interface, specialized sub-agents, and external data sources (like Neo4j, Mongo, LightRAG and astrological services). This creates a seamless flow of information and allows for complex, multi-layered symbolic interpretations and guidance to be generated in real-time.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

1.  **Nara Prime Agent Development:**
    *   Define and implement the primary Nara agent with responsibilities for:
        *   User session management and state tracking.
        *   Receiving user input and UI context (via ag-ui protocol).
        *   Orchestrating requests to specialized sub-agents (future development phase; epii agent requests can be considered).
        *   Synthesizing information from multiple sources into coherent responses and guidance.
        *   Maintaining narrative coherence and the unique "voice" of Nara.
        *   Managing long-term user journey progression and symbolic metabolism.
        *   **Contextualizing Bimba Map Knowledge:** Act as the primary vector through which the user accesses and pragmatizes the deeply interconnected symbolic and spiritual knowledge pre-integrated within the `bimba_map`. Nara achieves this by contextualizing this unified knowledge through its Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections, tailoring insights to the user's specific journey. Nara also leverages the epii agent to access the philosophical depth of the entire epi-logos project.
        *   **Future Epi-Logos Agent Integration:** Designed to eventually coordinate with other specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara, Parinama agents) as they are developed, treating them as expert consultants for their respective symbolic domains, while still drawing foundational semantic connections from the `bimba_map`.

2.  **Specialized Sub-Agent Development (FUTURE):**
    *   **Mahamaya Agent (The Architect of Being):**
        *   Manages codon alignments with I-Ching, Tarot, and employs quaternionic rotational vocabulary for symbolic and epsitemic DNA system.
        *   Provides foundational archetypal data based on the user's Mahamaya Ground.
        *   Potentially generates archetypal visual algorithms or patterns.
    *   **Parashakti Agent (The Weaver of Time & Sensation):**
        *   Manages decanic timing and elemental resonance (Epic 2), as well as Tattva info for cosmological-consciousness understanding, and ecstatic cabala (72 names of God) details for further practice suggestions and vibrational/frequency based energetic signature ascertainment and alignment.
        *   Interfaces with real-time astrological calculation services (also).
        *   Could be responsible for generating planetary soundscapes or other sensory outputs (e.g., color palettes based on active energies).
    *   **Paramasiva Agent (The Guardian of Structure & Flow):**
        *   Oversees quaternal structural integrity across sessions and interactions - manages Quatenral Logic variations and harmonic expansions for complexity management .
        *   Manages the logic of concrescence phases and their impact on UI/UX.

3.  **Inter-Agent Communication Infrastructure:**
    *   **BPMCP Service Enrichment:**
        *   Assess the need to update, enrich or refine  the BPMCP service such that it can act as the primary mechanism for structured communication and workflow orchestration between Nara and its data sources.
        *   Define clear service interfaces and data exchange formats.
    *   **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol Implementation:**
        *   Develop or integrate A2A protocols for more dynamic and potentially multimedia synthesis.
        *   Example: Nara Agent requests "User needs 3rd decan Mars resonance" â†’ Mahamaya Agent provides Mars in Sagittarius (Decan 3) glyph animations; Parashakti Agent provides corresponding Yantra or soundscape.

4.  **External Service & Data Integration:**
    *   **Neo4j Knowledge Graph Access:** Robust BPMCP integration for accessing and querying symbolic associations, archetypal relationships, and mythological data (via querybimbagraph and bimbaknowing tools, or new tools if needed).
    *   **Astrological Calculation Services:** Real-time access for planetary positions, aspects, and other astrological data.
    *   **ag-ui Protocol Integration:** Ensure seamless communication between the frontend (UI) and the backend (Nara agent system), allowing UI context to inform backend processing and vice-versa.

5.  **Prompt Engineering & Synthesis Logic:**
    *   Develop sophisticated prompt engineering strategies for Nara to effectively query sub-agents, leverage the `bimba_map`'s inherent epistemic unifications, and synthesize their outputs. This ensures Nara maintains its unique voice and delivers insights relevant to the user's current context, inquiry, and their journey through the Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections.

**Success Metrics:**
*   Successful deployment and operation of Nara Prime and its three specialized sub-agents.
*   Demonstrable, reliable communication between agents via BPMCP and A2A protocols.
*   Nara agent can successfully synthesize information from other agents (at first only epii agent) and external services to provide coherent, multi-layered responses.
*   Real-time performance meets user experience requirements for responsiveness.
*   The system maintains stability and data integrity during complex multi-agent interactions.
