# Epic 2: Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement

**Goal:** Transform the Oracle section into a dynamic theater of decanic embodiment, integrating real-time astrological conditions, Hermetic decanic imagery, and the user's unique archetypal foundation (Epic 1) to provide deeply personalized, embodied, and temporally relevant symbolic guidance. This corresponds to Position #1 in the Quaternary Framework.

**Core Concept:** The Oracle section transcends simple card reading to become a decanic theater. Each interaction is a live synthesis of the user's natal predispositions, current cosmic energies, and the specific symbolism of the decans, fostering a bodily resonant experience of archetypal forces.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

1.  **Oracle Section Enhancement - Decanic Theater:**
    *   **Dynamic Card Rendering:** When a card is drawn, it visually displays its current Hermetic decanic association (e.g., the 5 of Cups explicitly shows or links to imagery/text for Venus in Scorpio's 3rd decan).
    *   **Real-Time Astrological Integration:** Oracle interpretations dynamically adjust based on current planetary positions, planetary hours, and moon phases. This requires API integration with astrological calculation services.
    *   **Natal Chart Cross-Referencing:** Guidance is personalized by cross-referencing drawn cards and current transits with the user's natal chart (from Mahamaya Ground, Epic 1).
    *   **Bodily Resonance Mapping:**
        *   Explore/develop features to overlay or project card imagery and their decanic symbols onto the user's energetic centers (pranic channels, body parts, chakras) via human design inspired body-mapping.
        *   This aims to create a more direct, visually clear sense of the archetypal energies at play.

2.  **Identity Dynamics Integration - Decanic Lifestyle:**
    *   Extend the Identity Dynamics section (built in Epic 1) to auto-generate practical, decanically-informed practice suggestions:
        *   **Decanic Nutrition Plans:** Based on natal Venus positions and current decanic influences.
        *   **Elemental Movement Practices:** Tailored to solar and lunar decans, and the user's elemental temperament.
        *   **Pranic System-Decan Correspondence:** Leverage bimba_map relations between pranic channels and decans, offering targeted practices for energetic alignment and energy-body meditation.

3.  **Advanced Symbolic Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Develop the backend logic (potentially within the Parashakti Agent or coordinated by Nara Agent) to synthesize these multiple layers of information (card meaning, decan, natal placements, current transits, chakra associations) into coherent, actionable guidance.
    *   This involves sophisticated prompt engineering and potentially knowledge graph lookups (Neo4j) - detail on decan influences and imagery, astrological modalities, pranic channels, etc in the bimba_map.

4.  **User Interface for Decanic Exploration:**
    *   The Oracle interface should allow users to explore the decanic associations of cards, their natal placements, and current transits in an intuitive way.
    *   Visual cues should highlight active decanic influences during a reading.

**Success Metrics:**
*   Demonstrable integration of real-time decanic and astrological data into Oracle readings.
*   Users can access and understand personalized decanic information related to their natal chart and current readings.
*   Positive user feedback on the depth and relevance of decanically-enhanced guidance.
*   Successful generation of decanically-informed psycho-spiritual practice suggestions in the Identity Dynamics section.
*   (If AR pursued) Functional prototype of bodily resonance mapping.
