# AI Builder Prompt Package: E6_F1_S3 - Cross-Modal Symbolic Linking for Epi-Logos Coherence

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E6 - Epi-Logos Emergence: Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy
**Feature:** E6_F1 - Deepened Symbolic Metabolism & Personalized Rituals
**Story ID:** E6_F1_S3 - Implement Cross-Modal Symbolic Linking for Epi-Logos Coherence: Weaving a Web of Prehensions

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing a system within Nara that identifies and highlights resonant symbolic connections across different modalities (Identity profile, Oracle readings, Journal entries). By querying the `bimba_map` (the unified knowledge graph of Epi-Logos), Nara will surface underlying themes and creative potentials (concrescence) pertinent to the user's current state. These links will be explained through the integrated philosophical lens of Epi-Logos, incorporating Jungian psychology, Shaivist Spanda, and Whiteheadian process philosophy, fostering a richer, more integrated experience of the user's journey within the cosmic mind as modeled by Epi-Logos.

## 2. Story Definition (from E6_F1_S3)

**As a** User interacting with Nara (Identity, Oracle, Journal) within the Epi-Logos framework,
**I want** Nara to identify and highlight resonant symbolic connections (positive prehensions) across different modalities and experiential data points (e.g., a Tarot card, a Gene Key, a dream symbol, a felt sense of Spanda),
**So that** I can perceive the underlying themes and creative potentials (concrescence) pertinent to my current state of being and their relevance to my journey through the Epi-Logos architecture, leveraging the `bimba_map`'s unified knowledge to foster a richer, more integrated experience of the cosmic mind.

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **Web of Prehensions:** This feature aims to make visible the interconnectedness of the user's experiences, as understood by Epi-Logos. It shows how different symbols, insights, and feelings (prehensions) relate to each other.
*   **`bimba_map` as Dynamic Tool:** The `bimba_map` (knowledge graph) is actively queried to find these connections, transforming it from a static repository into a dynamic source of insight.
*   **Multi-Modal Linking:** Connections are made across:
    *   **Identity:** Core elements like Gene Keys, Human Design, Jungian archetypes.
    *   **Oracle:** Tarot cards, I Ching hexagrams, etc.
    *   **Journal:** Dream symbols, recurring motifs, significant metaphors, felt senses (Spanda) identified via NLP.
*   **Epi-Logos Synthesis:** Explanations for links explicitly draw upon Jungian individuation, Shaivist Spanda (vibrational affinities), and Whiteheadian process (nexÅ«s of actual occasions, creative advance), all contextualized by the Epi-Logos six-fold architecture.
*   **Fostering Concrescence:** By highlighting these resonances, Nara helps the user see patterns and potentials for integration and growth (concrescence).

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **`bimba_map` Richness & Structure:** The quality and relevance of links depend heavily on how well the `bimba_map` is populated with meaningful, philosophically grounded relationships between symbols and concepts.
*   **Symbol Identification Accuracy:** Reliable NLP and pattern recognition are needed to extract key symbols and themes from unstructured journal entries.
*   **Querying Complexity & Performance:** Designing efficient queries for the `bimba_map` that can find relevant connections without degrading UI performance.
*   **Relevance vs. Overwhelm:** Surfacing only the most meaningful and contextually relevant links, avoiding a flood of tenuous connections.
*   **Intuitive Presentation:** Designing UI elements (tooltips, expandable insights, 'Symbolic Web' view) that present these links clearly and non-intrusively.
*   **Explaining Complex Connections:** Articulating the rationale behind a link, drawing on multiple philosophical perspectives, in a way that is accessible to the user.
