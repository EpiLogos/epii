# AI Builder Prompt Package: E6_F2_S3 - Feedback Loops on Interpretation Skills

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E6 - Epi-Logos Emergence: Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy
**Feature:** E6_F2 - Cultivating Symbolic Literacy & Interpretive Autonomy
**Story ID:** E6_F2_S3 - Provide Feedback Loops on Interpretation Skills for Enhancing Epi-Logos Perception: Cultivating Prehensive Dialogue and Concrescent Awareness

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing a feedback system within Nara that helps users refine their symbolic interpretation skills. Nara will identify potentially related symbolic inputs across different modalities (e.g., Oracle, Journal) or timeframes. It will then (optionally or upon prompt) illustrate how these inputs might connect through the `bimba_map`'s relational pathways, explaining these connections using the integrated Epi-Logos philosophy (synthesizing Jungian, Shaivist, and Whiteheadian perspectives). The aim is to enhance the user's perception of these interconnections (prehensive pathways), their relevance to the Epi-Logos framework, and their potential for creative advance and concrescence.

## 2. Story Definition (from E6_F2_S3)

**As a** User learning to interpret my own symbolic experiences (prehensions, archetypal encounters, Spanda events),
**I want** Nara to offer feedback by highlighting how different symbolic inputs (e.g., from an Oracle reading and a Journal entry) might relate through the `bimba_map`'s underlying connections—connections illuminated by the integrated Epi-Logos insights (synthesizing Jungian, Shaivist, and Whiteheadian perspectives)—
**So that** I can refine my perception of these interconnections (prehensive pathways), their relevance to the Epi-Logos philosophical map (a living mandala of concrescent understanding), and their potential for creative advance, thereby enhancing my symbolic literacy and capacity for conscious participation in my individuation journey.

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **Cultivating Epi-Logos Perception:** The core goal is to help users develop the ability to see their lives and experiences through the synthesized lens of Epi-Logos.
*   **Revealing Prehensive Nexūs:** The system makes visible the potential underlying connections (prehensions forming nexūs) between seemingly disparate experiences, as mapped in the `bimba_map`.
*   **Multi-Perspectival Illumination:** Connections are explained not just as data links, but through the rich, integrated insights of Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism (Spanda), and Whiteheadian process philosophy, all within the Epi-Logos framework.
*   **Feedback, Not Correction:** The system offers reflections and potential lines of inquiry, aiming to affirm or gently expand user interpretations rather than imposing definitive answers.
*   **Enhancing Symbolic Fluency:** By observing how Nara makes connections, users learn to apply Epi-Logos principles to their own interpretations, fostering a deeper understanding of individuation, creative advance, and concrescence.
*   **Living Mandala of Understanding:** The feedback helps the user see the Epi-Logos map not as static, but as a dynamic field of potential connections relevant to their ongoing process of becoming.

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **Identifying Meaningful Relationships:** Developing algorithms to discern truly relevant connections between symbolic inputs versus coincidental ones.
*   **`bimba_map` Query Complexity:** Efficiently querying the `bimba_map` to find and explain these relational pathways.
*   **Nuance in Explanation:** Crafting explanations that are insightful and reflect the depth of the Epi-Logos synthesis without being overly academic or prescriptive.
*   **User Interpretation Integration:** Designing how to incorporate and respond to user's own stated interpretations (if available).
*   **Avoiding Overwhelm/Misinterpretation:** Presenting potential connections in a way that invites curiosity rather than confusion or the sense of a definitive 'answer'.
*   **UI for Feedback & Exploration:** Designing an intuitive interface for presenting these feedback loops and allowing optional interactive exploration of `bimba_map` segments.
*   **Maintaining User Agency:** Ensuring the feedback empowers the user and supports their autonomy in meaning-making.

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As an AI system architect, expert in symbolic interpretation, and designer of intelligent learning systems, with profound knowledge of Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism, Whiteheadian process philosophy, and the synthesized Epi-Logos meta-framework, you are tasked with designing the 'Feedback Loops on Interpretation Skills' feature for the Nara application, as per User Story E6_F2_S3.

**Objective:** Develop a system where Nara offers feedback to users by highlighting potential connections between their symbolic inputs (e.g., from Oracle readings and Journal entries). These connections will be illuminated by the `bimba_map`'s relational pathways and explained through the integrated Epi-Logos insights (Jungian, Shaivist, Whiteheadian). The goal is to help users refine their perception of these interconnections (prehensive pathways), enhance their symbolic literacy, and deepen their understanding of their individuation journey and potential for creative advance and concrescence.

**Given Inputs (assume access to):
1.  User Story E6_F2_S3.
2.  Detailed `bimba_map` specifications, including its encoding of relationships and Epi-Logos interpretations.
3.  A comprehensive Epi-Logos Philosophical Framework document.
4.  Information on Nara's NLP capabilities for processing user input.
5.  Protocols for accessing and correlating Oracle and Journal data.
6.  Illustrative scenarios of symbolic inputs, potential connections, and sample user interpretations.
7.  Nara's UI/UX guidelines.

**Produce the Following Outputs (as detailed in Section 6 of the Prompt Package E6_F2_S3_prompt_package.md):

1.  **Connection Identification Logic:** Define the strategy for identifying related symbolic inputs and assessing connection relevance.

2.  **Feedback Generation Framework:** How will Nara explain connections using `bimba_map` and Epi-Logos? Provide templates/guidelines for phrasing and incorporating user interpretations.

3.  **`bimba_map` Visualization for Feedback (Optional):** Conceptualize visual presentation of `bimba_map` segments for interactive exploration.

4.  **UI/UX Design for Feedback Presentation:** Design how feedback is delivered to the user (notifications, inline suggestions, etc.).

5.  **Interaction Flow for Feedback Loop:** Detail the user's journey with this feature.

6.  **Language and Tone Guidelines for Feedback:** Ensure feedback is supportive, reflective, and empowering.

7.  **Documentation Plan for `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY`:** Outline the documentation strategy.

**Key Considerations for Your Design:**
*   **Refining Perception:** The system must effectively help users see subtle connections they might otherwise miss.
*   **Non-Prescriptive Support:** Feedback should guide and illuminate, not dictate or correct.
*   **Epi-Logos Depth:** Explanations must accurately reflect the synthesized depth of the three core philosophies within Epi-Logos.
*   **User Agency:** The design must always reinforce the user's role as the primary interpreter and agent in their journey.
*   **Learning Tool:** The feature should implicitly teach users how to engage more deeply with symbolic language through an Epi-Logos lens.

Present your response in a structured format, addressing each of the 7 output points with clear, actionable technical, design, and philosophical details.
