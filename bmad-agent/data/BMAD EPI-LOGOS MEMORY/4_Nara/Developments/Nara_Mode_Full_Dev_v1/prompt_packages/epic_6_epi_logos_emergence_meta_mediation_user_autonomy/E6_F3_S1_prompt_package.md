# AI Builder Prompt Package: E6_F3_S1 - Symbolic Literacy Index

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E6 - Epi-Logos Emergence: Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy
**Feature:** E6_F3 - Transformational Impact Metrics & Epi-Logos Coherence
**Story ID:** E6_F3_S1 - Develop a Symbolic Literacy Index: Gauging Prehensive Fluency and Concrescent Capacity as a Transformational Impact Metric

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing a 'Symbolic Literacy Index' within Nara. This index aims to offer users an optional, qualitative insight into their evolving ability to self-interpret symbolic experiences (dreams, synchronicities, Oracle readings) and engage with symbolic language as a dynamic process of meaning-making. It reflects their 'Prehensive Fluency' (ability to perceive and integrate diverse symbolic inputs) and 'Concrescent Capacity' (potential for creative advance and novel integration of experiences), all contextualized by the Epi-Logos framework (synthesizing Jungian, Shaivist, and Whiteheadian thought).

## 2. Story Definition (from E6_F3_S1)

**As a** User on a journey of self-discovery and creative advance with Nara (a process informed by Jungian individuation, Shaivist Spanda, and Whiteheadian concrescence),
**I want** an optional way to see an indicator of my evolving ability to self-interpret dreams, synchronicities, Oracle readings, and other symbolic experiences (a 'Symbolic Literacy Index' reflecting my 'Prehensive Fluency'),
**So that** I can gain a sense of my progress in understanding and engaging with symbolic language as a dynamic process of meaning-making, fostering deeper participation in the Epi-Logos framework and enhancing my capacity for novel concrescence.

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **Gauging Intangible Growth:** The index attempts to provide feedback on a deeply personal and often intangible aspect of psycho-spiritual development â€“ the ability to understand and work with symbols.
*   **Prehensive Fluency:** Reflects the user's skill in perceiving, connecting, and making sense of various symbolic inputs (prehensions) from their inner and outer worlds.
*   **Concrescent Capacity:** Indicates the user's growing ability to weave these prehensions into new, meaningful wholes (concrescence), leading to creative advance and satisfaction.
*   **Epi-Logos Synthesis:** The index is grounded in the integrated principles of Jungian psychology (individuation, archetypal understanding), Kashmir Shaivism (Spanda, recognizing the vibrational nature of experience), and Whiteheadian philosophy (prehension, actual occasions, creative advance).
*   **Supporting Autonomy:** The metric is designed to affirm and encourage the user's own interpretive capacities, not to replace them or create dependency.
*   **Ethical Consideration:** Paramount importance is given to privacy, user choice in viewing the metric, and framing it qualitatively to avoid judgment or unhelpful gamification.

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **Defining Measurable Proxies:** Identifying reliable data points from user interactions (journaling, tool use) that can serve as proxies for 'symbolic literacy,' 'prehensive fluency,' and 'concrescent capacity'.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity & Nuance:** Developing an algorithm (even heuristic) that can meaningfully interpret qualitative data (like journal entries) and avoid simplistic or misleading conclusions.
*   **Qualitative Presentation:** Designing a way to present the 'index' that is encouraging, insightful, and avoids the pitfalls of a numerical score.
*   **Subjectivity of Interpretation:** Acknowledging the inherent subjectivity in symbolic interpretation and ensuring the index doesn't impose a rigid 'correctness'.
*   **Avoiding Gamification/Anxiety:** Ensuring the feature does not lead to users trying to 'score higher' in a way that distorts their natural engagement.
*   **Data Privacy:** Strict adherence to privacy principles in handling sensitive user data.
*   **Longitudinal Tracking:** The index implies tracking development over time, requiring careful data management and trend analysis.

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As an AI system architect, expert in psychometrics, qualitative data analysis, and user experience design, with profound knowledge of Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism, Whiteheadian process philosophy, and the synthesized Epi-Logos meta-framework, you are tasked with designing the 'Symbolic Literacy Index' for the Nara application, as per User Story E6_F3_S1.

**Objective:** Develop a conceptual framework and design for an optional 'Symbolic Literacy Index'. This index should provide users with qualitative insights into their evolving 'Prehensive Fluency' (ability to self-interpret symbols and connect diverse prehensions) and 'Concrescent Capacity' (potential for creative advance and novel integration of experiences). The index must be grounded in Epi-Logos principles, ethically sound, and presented in a way that fosters self-awareness and encourages deeper engagement with symbolic language, without causing anxiety or gamification.

**Given Inputs (assume access to):
1.  User Story E6_F3_S1.
2.  A comprehensive Epi-Logos Philosophical Framework document.
3.  Details of Nara's NLP capabilities for analyzing user journal entries and other textual inputs.
4.  Data on user engagement with Nara's self-interpretation tools.
5.  Nara's ethical guidelines for user metrics.
6.  Relevant conceptual models of symbolic development.
7.  Anonymized/hypothetical sample user data illustrating different engagement patterns.

**Produce the Following Outputs (as detailed in Section 6 of the Prompt Package E6_F3_S1_prompt_package.md):

1.  **Conceptual Definition of the Symbolic Literacy Index:** Clearly define 'Prehensive Fluency' and 'Concrescent Capacity' in the Epi-Logos context and the key dimensions the index reflects.

2.  **Data Source Identification & Processing Logic:** Specify data points and analysis methods.

3.  **Algorithmic Approach (Conceptual Design):** Outline the algorithm for generating the index, including factors and temporal considerations.

4.  **Qualitative Presentation Framework:** Design how the index is presented (descriptors, visuals) optionally and non-judgmentally.

5.  **Ethical Safeguards and User Control:** Detail privacy measures, opt-in/out mechanisms, and explanatory language.

6.  **Internal Feedback Loop Design:** How can index-related data improve Nara's features?

7.  **Documentation Plan for `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY`:** Outline the documentation strategy.

**Key Considerations for Your Design:**
*   **Meaningful Reflection:** The index must offer genuine insight into the user's development.
*   **Ethical Integrity:** Prioritize user well-being, privacy, and autonomy.
*   **Qualitative Emphasis:** Avoid reducing complex personal growth to a simplistic score.
*   **Epi-Logos Alignment:** Ensure the index and its interpretation fully align with the goals of fostering individuation, prehensive fluency, and concrescent capacity.
*   **Feasibility:** Propose a design that is conceptually sound and acknowledges potential implementation challenges.
