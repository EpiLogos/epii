# AI Builder Prompt Package: E6_F1_S2 - Archetypal Composting & Personalized Rituals

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E6 - Epi-Logos Emergence: Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy
**Feature:** E6_F1 - Deepened Symbolic Metabolism & Personalized Rituals
**Story ID:** E6_F1_S2 - Enable Archetypal Composting and Personalized Ritual Creation as Epi-Logos Praxis: Integrating Jungian, Shaivist, and Whiteheadian Insights

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing a system within Nara that helps users identify recurring or challenging archetypal patterns (e.g., shadow aspects, complexes, dissonant prehensions) from their Oracle readings, Journal entries, and Mahamaya Ground configurations. Based on these identifications, Nara will suggest personalized, symbolic "composting" rituals or reflective practices. These suggestions will synthesize insights from Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism (Spanda), and Whiteheadian process philosophy, all framed within the overarching Epi-Logos praxis. The goal is to empower users to consciously engage with and integrate these psychic energies, transforming them into catalysts for individuation and creative advance (concrescence).

## 2. Story Definition (from E6_F1_S2)

**As a** User navigating my individuation journey within the Epi-Logos framework, drawing on Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism, and Whiteheadian process philosophy,
**I want** Nara to help me identify recurring or challenging archetypal patterns (shadow aspects, unresolved complexes, dissonant prehensions) emerging from Oracle readings, Journal entries, and Mahamaya Ground configurations, and suggest personalized, symbolic "composting" rituals or reflective practices that synthesize these wisdom traditions,
**So that** I can consciously engage with and integrate these psychic energies (recognizing their inherent Spanda or creative pulse), transforming them from sources of unconscious conflict or negative prehensions into catalysts for individuation and creative advance (concrescence), fostering deeper self-understanding, psychic wholeness, and a more harmonious participation in the living mandala of knowledge that is Epi-Logos.

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **Archetypal Composting (Epi-Logos Praxis):** This core concept reframes challenging psychic material not as something to be repressed, but as raw material for growth. It involves conscious engagement to understand and integrate these energies, transforming them.
*   **Multi-Perspectival Synthesis:** Rituals and practices draw from:
    *   **Jungian Psychology:** Working with shadow, complexes, archetypal amplification, active imagination.
    *   **Kashmir Shaivism:** Recognizing the Spanda (creative pulse/vibration) within all experiences, even challenging ones; transforming dissonant vibrations.
    *   **Whiteheadian Process Philosophy:** Addressing negative prehensions, fostering novel concrescence and creative advance from diverse experiential data.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Requires sophisticated analysis of user data (journals, Oracle readings) to identify potent or recurring archetypal themes, vibrational dissonances, or patterns of negative prehension.
*   **Personalized & Symbolic:** Suggestions must be tailored to the identified pattern and use the symbolic language of Epi-Logos (Tarot, alchemy, elements, its six-fold architecture).
*   **User Agency:** The system acts as a Socratic guide, empowering the user's self-discovery and choice.

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **Identifying "Challenging" Patterns:** Defining criteria and developing NLP/AI methods to reliably identify patterns that are genuinely challenging or indicative of shadow material, without over-interpreting or misinterpreting.
*   **Designing Meaningful Rituals:** Creating a framework for generating ritual/practice suggestions that are symbolically rich, psychologically sound (across Jungian, Shaivist, Whiteheadian perspectives), and practically implementable by the user.
*   **Maintaining Symbolic Coherence:** Ensuring all suggestions align with the established symbolic systems and philosophical underpinnings of Epi-Logos.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Providing suggestions for engaging with potentially difficult psychic material requires utmost sensitivity, clear framing, and emphasis on user agency and professional help if needed.
*   **Personalization Complexity:** Tailoring suggestions effectively based on diverse user inputs and identified patterns.
*   **Measuring Efficacy (Optional):** Long-term, how might the system (or user) gauge the effectiveness of these practices?

## 5. Inputs for AI Builder

1.  **User Story Document:** `story_E6_F1_S2_archetypal_composting_personalized_rituals.md`.
2.  **Conceptual Framework for "Archetypal Composting":** A document detailing this Epi-Logos praxis, its philosophical roots (Jungian integration, Shaivist recognition, Whiteheadian transformation), and its goals.

5.  **Outputs from E6_F1_S1 (Refined Alchemical Phase Detection):** The integrated conceptual model and phase detection logic, as this can inform the timing and nature of composting suggestions.
6.  **Examples of Archetypal Patterns/Challenging Material:** Illustrative scenarios or anonymized/synthetic user data snippets showing examples of shadow aspects, complexes, or dissonant prehensions that the system should identify.
7.  **Library of Potential Ritual Components/Reflective Practices:** A preliminary list of actions, symbols, meditation techniques, journaling prompts, or active imagination exercises drawn from Jungian, Shaivist, Whiteheadian, and general contemplative traditions that could be adapted.

**Given Inputs (assume access to):
1.  User Story E6_F1_S2.
2.  A detailed conceptual framework for "Archetypal Composting" as an Epi-Logos praxis.
3.  Comprehensive guides to Epi-Logos symbolic systems and its Six-Fold Architecture.
4.  The outputs from E6_F1_S1 (Refined Alchemical Phase Detection system).
5.  Illustrative examples of challenging archetypal patterns.
6.  A preliminary library of potential ritual components and reflective practices.
7.  Ethical guidelines for psycho-spiritual suggestions.

**Produce the Following Outputs (as detailed in Section 6 of the Prompt Package E6_F1_S2_prompt_package.md):
