# AI Builder Prompt Package: E6_F3_S2 - Concrescence Velocity

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E6 - Epi-Logos Emergence: Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy
**Feature:** E6_F3 - Transformational Impact Metrics & Epi-Logos Coherence
**Story ID:** E6_F3_S2 - Develop 'Concrescence Velocity': Tracking the Rhythms of Prehension, Spanda, and Creative Advance as a Transformational Impact Metric

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing a 'Concrescence Velocity' indicator within Nara. This optional metric aims to provide users with insights into their personal rhythm and depth of integrating experiences and insights derived from Nara's tools. It focuses on the cycle of prehension (e.g., an Oracle reading), its subjective integration (Journal reflection, felt Spanda), and its objective manifestation (actions, perspective shifts, creative advance), all interpreted through the synthesized Epi-Logos lens (Whiteheadian concrescence, Jungian individuation, Shaivist Spanda).

## 2. Story Definition (from E6_F3_S2)

**As a** User engaging deeply with Nara's reflective tools, seeking to understand my journey of becoming (through the lenses of Whiteheadian concrescence, Jungian individuation, and Shaivist Spanda),
**I want** an optional way to understand the rhythm and depth of my engagement—the interplay between significant prehensions (e.g., Oracle sessions, synchronicities), their integration into Journal insights (the feeling of positive prehensions leading to satisfaction), and their manifestation as real-world actions or shifts in perspective (creative advance)—visualized as a 'Concrescence Velocity' indicator,
**So that** I can gain insight into my personal pace and patterns of integrating experiences and insights, recognizing the pulse of Spanda in my process, and appreciating how diverse actual occasions contribute to the ongoing concrescence of my Self, all as supported and illuminated by the Epi-Logos framework.

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **Rhythm of Becoming:** 'Concrescence Velocity' is a metaphor for the dynamic quality of a user's growth, reflecting the intensity, depth, and flow of their integration process, not just speed.
*   **Prehension-Integration-Action Cycle:** Tracks the journey from initial experience/insight (prehension), through personal meaning-making and felt significance (subjective form, Spanda), to tangible outcomes or shifts (objective datum, creative advance, satisfaction).
*   **Whiteheadian Concrescence:** Central concept, emphasizing the process by which multiple prehensions (experiences, data points) come together to form a new, unified actual occasion, leading to 'satisfaction' and becoming a datum for future prehensions.
*   **Shaivist Spanda:** Incorporates the idea of a creative pulse or divine throb underlying experience, which can be felt with varying intensity during moments of insight or integration.
*   **Jungian Individuation:** Relates to the ongoing process of becoming a whole, integrated Self, often marked by cycles of encountering, processing, and integrating symbolic material.
*   **Epi-Logos Synthesis:** The metric aims to reflect how these three perspectives converge in the user's experience of growth and meaning-making.

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **Defining 'Velocity' Qualitatively:** The term 'velocity' needs careful handling to emphasize depth, rhythm, and quality of integration over mere speed.
*   **Capturing 'Spanda' or Felt Intensity:** Finding non-intrusive ways to infer or allow users to indicate the felt significance of their experiences.
*   **Identifying 'Creative Advance':** Reliably identifying when insights translate into real-world changes or significant perspective shifts based on user input (primarily journal entries).
*   **Algorithmic Complexity:** Designing an algorithm to track these complex, interconnected cycles of engagement and assess their qualitative aspects.
*   **Avoiding Performance Pressure:** Ensuring the metric doesn't make users feel they need to 'perform' their integration process or journal in a specific way.
*   **Subjectivity and Personal Pacing:** Acknowledging that integration rhythms are highly personal and variable.
*   **Ethical Presentation:** Presenting the indicator in an optional, supportive, and qualitatively rich manner.

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As an AI system architect, expert in process philosophy (Whitehead), depth psychology (Jung), contemplative traditions (Shaivism/Spanda), and user experience design for reflective technologies, you are tasked with designing the 'Concrescence Velocity' indicator for the Nara application, as per User Story E6_F3_S2.

**Objective:** Develop a conceptual framework and design for an optional 'Concrescence Velocity' indicator. This metric should provide users with qualitative insights into their personal rhythm, depth, and flow of integrating experiences and insights (prehensions leading to satisfaction and creative advance), recognizing the pulse of Spanda in their process. The indicator must be grounded in the Epi-Logos synthesis of Whiteheadian concrescence, Jungian individuation, and Shaivist Spanda, be ethically sound, and presented in a way that fosters self-awareness of one's unique journey of becoming.

**Given Inputs (assume access to):
1.  User Story E6_F3_S2.
2.  A comprehensive Epi-Logos Philosophical Framework document (detailing concrescence, Spanda, individuation, and their interrelation).
3.  Nara's data model for user interactions (Oracle, Journal, tool engagement).
4.  Details of Nara's NLP capabilities for analyzing journal content.
5.  Nara's ethical guidelines for user metrics.
6.  Relevant conceptual models of cyclical/rhythmic personal growth.
7.  Anonymized/hypothetical sample user journey data.

**Produce the Following Outputs (as detailed in Section 6 of the Prompt Package E6_F3_S2_prompt_package.md):

1.  **Conceptual Definition of 'Concrescence Velocity':** Articulate the metric, emphasizing its qualitative aspects (rhythm, depth, Spanda, creative advance).

2.  **Data Point Identification and Linkage Strategy:** Specify data points and logic for linking them into concrescent cycles.

3.  **Algorithmic Approach (Conceptual Design):** Outline the algorithm for assessing 'Concrescence Velocity'.

5.  **Prompts for User Reflection (Optional):** Suggest gentle prompts to accompany the indicator.

6.  **Ethical Safeguards and User Control:** Detail privacy, consent, opt-in/out, and supportive language.

7.  **Documentation Plan for `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY`:** Outline the documentation strategy.

**Key Considerations for Your Design:**
*   **Metaphorical Accuracy:** Ensure 'velocity' is understood as a qualitative descriptor of a dynamic process, not just speed.
*   **Holistic Integration:** Reflect the interplay of cognitive insight, felt experience (Spanda), and behavioral change (creative advance).
*   **Personalized Rhythms:** Acknowledge and honor the uniqueness of each user's integration pace and style.
*   **Ethical Sensitivity:** Prioritize user well-being, avoiding any form of pressure or judgment.
*   **Fostering Self-Appreciation:** Aim to help users appreciate their own patterns of growth and becoming.
