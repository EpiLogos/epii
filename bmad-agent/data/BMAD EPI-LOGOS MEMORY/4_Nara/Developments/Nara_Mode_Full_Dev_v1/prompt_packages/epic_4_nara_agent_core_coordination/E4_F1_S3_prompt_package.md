# AI Builder Prompt Package: E4_F1_S3 - Nara: Design for Future Epi-Logos Agent Coordination

## 1. Overview

**Story ID:** E4_F1_S3
**Epic:** 4 - Nara Agent Core & Coordination: The Orchestrating Intelligence
**Feature:** F1 - Nara Agent Development
**Project:** Nara Mode Full Dev v1 (Epi-Logos)
**Objective:** Design the architectural provisions within Nara Prime to enable future coordination with other specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara, Mahamaya, Parashakti, Paramasiva), ensuring Nara can leverage a wider range of expertise to deepen the user's individuation journey, all while maintaining `bimba_map` as the foundational semantic layer.

## 2. Story Definition

**As a** System Architect planning for future expansion, guided by Jungian principles of psychic wholeness and Saivist understanding of consciousness's diverse expressions,
**I want** Nara's design to incorporate the capability to eventually coordinate with other specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara for non-dual inquiry, Mahamaya for understanding illusion and reality, Parashakti for the energetic/vibrational power of consciousness, Paramasiva for the potentiation of unity) by treating them as expert consultants for their respective symbolic domains and modes of conscious experience,
**So that** Nara can leverage a wider range of specialized knowledge to deepen the user's individuation journey and their appreciation of the multifaceted play (Lila) of consciousness, while maintaining the `bimba_map` as the foundational source of semantic connections and overall coherence reflecting the Self (Atman) and ultimate reality (Paramashiva).

## 3. Technical Context & Design Philosophy

*   **Focus:** Architectural design within Nara Prime for future extensibility and inter-agent coordination. No implementation of future agents themselves.
*   **Extensible Orchestration Interface:** Nara's internal orchestration logic (from E4_F1_S1) needs an interface for registering, discovering, querying, and receiving info from new specialized agents.
*   **Consultative Model:** Nara identifies needs for specialized input (e.g., deep alchemy, cosmology, specific meditative practices for Spanda/Pratibha) and routes queries to appropriate future agents. Nara synthesizes expert input for the user.
*   **`bimba_map` as Foundation:** `bimba_map` provides overarching context (collective unconscious, unity of consciousness) and ensures coherent integration of specialized insights with the user's journey and Nara's core symbolic framework. Future agent outputs should ideally be relatable to `bimba_map` concepts.
*   **Standardized Communication (Conceptual):** Outline potential communication protocols/data formats (considering A2A protocols from E4_F3) for forward compatibility.
*   **Future Agent Roles (High-Level):** Define envisioned roles for agents like Anuttara (non-dual inquiry for Self/Atman), Mahamaya (illusion/reality), Parashakti (energetic power/Spanda), Paramasiva (unity potentiation) to inform orchestration design.
*   **Philosophical Grounding:** The design supports an expanding exploration of psyche and consciousness, aligning with Jungian wholeness and Saivist multifaceted expressions of Paramashiva and Lila.

## 4. Constraints and Challenges

*   **Designing for Unknowns:** Creating a flexible interface without knowing the exact specifications of all future agents.
*   **Maintaining Coherence:** Ensuring that input from diverse specialized agents is synthesized by Nara into a consistent and understandable experience for the user, anchored by `bimba_map`.
*   **Scalability of Orchestration:** As the number of agents grows, Nara's orchestration logic must remain efficient.
*   **Semantic Interoperability:** How to ensure that concepts and data from different agents can be meaningfully related, potentially via `bimba_map` as a common ontology.
*   **Avoiding Over-Complication:** Keeping the initial design for future integration lean and focused on core extensibility points.

## 5. Inputs for AI Builder (Illustrative)

1.  **User Story:** (This document)
2.  **Nara Agent Foundation (E4_F1_S1 & E4_F1_S2):** Existing architecture of Nara Prime, including its orchestration logic and `bimba_map` interaction.
3.  **EFDD Concepts:** Brief descriptions of envisioned future agents (Anuttara, Mahamaya, Parashakti, Paramasiva) and their core domains of expertise related to Jungian and Saivist thought.
4.  **A2A Protocol Concepts (from E4_F3):** High-level ideas about how agent-to-agent communication might be structured.
5.  **Illustrative Coordination Scenarios (Conceptual):**
    *   *Scenario 1:* User expresses deep existential questions about the nature of Self. Nara, recognizing this requires non-dual inquiry, consults the (future) `Anuttara` agent. `Anuttara` provides reflective prompts. Nara integrates these with user's current `bimba_map` context (e.g., symbols related to Self archetype) and presents a synthesized response.
    *   *Scenario 2:* User's journal reveals intense experiences of energetic phenomena. Nara consults (future) `Parashakti` agent for insights on managing/understanding these energies (Spanda). `Parashakti` suggests practices. Nara links these to relevant `bimba_map` symbols of transformation.

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As a lead AI System Architect with expertise in multi-agent systems, Jungian psychology, and Saivist philosophy, design the architectural provisions within the Nara Prime agent (building on E4_F1_S1 and E4_F1_S2) to enable future coordination with a suite of specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara, Mahamaya, Parashakti, Paramasiva). This design should focus on future-proofing Nara, as outlined in User Story E4_F1_S3.

The core objective is to allow Nara to leverage diverse expert knowledge to deepen the user's individuation journey and their understanding of consciousness as a multifaceted play (Lila), while ensuring the `bimba_map` remains the foundational semantic and coherence layer, reflecting the Self (Atman) and ultimate reality (Paramashiva).

Deliver the following architectural designs:

1.  **Extensible Orchestration Architecture Diagram:** Illustrate how Nara's existing orchestration module will be enhanced with an agent registry, communication bus, and interfaces for specialized agents.
2.  **Abstract Agent Interface Specification:** Define the generic methods, data structures, and interaction patterns Nara will use to discover, query, and receive information from any future registered Epi-Logos agent.
3.  **Consultative Interaction Model:** Detail the workflow: how Nara identifies the need for specialized input, selects the appropriate consultant agent, passes context (including `bimba_map` references), manages the query, and synthesizes the expert response for the user. Emphasize Nara's role in maintaining user-facing coherence.
4.  **`bimba_map` as Coherence Layer Strategy:** Explain how Nara will use the `bimba_map` to provide context to specialized agents and to integrate their diverse outputs into the user's ongoing individuation narrative and Nara's core symbolic framework.
5.  **Conceptual Communication Protocol Stubs:** Provide example message formats for Nara-to-specialized-agent interactions, considering potential A2A standards and including fields for query type, contextual payload (with `bimba_map` links), and expected response characteristics.
6.  **High-Level Role & Interaction Profiles for Key Future Agents:** For Anuttara (non-dual inquiry), Mahamaya (illusion/reality), Parashakti (energetic dynamics/Spanda), and Paramasiva (unity potentiation), briefly define:
    *   Their primary domain of expertise.
    *   Types of queries Nara might route to them.
    *   How their expertise complements Nara and `bimba_map` in supporting the user's Jungian/Saivist journey.
7.  **Guidelines for Future Agent Integration:** Provide recommendations for developers of future Epi-Logos agents on how to design them for seamless integration with Nara's orchestration framework.

This design should prioritize flexibility, scalability, and the profound philosophical goals of the Epi-Logos project, ensuring Nara can evolve into a sophisticated coordinator of a rich, multi-agent ecosystem dedicated to human consciousness and transformation.
