# AI Builder Prompt Package: E5_F1_S2 - Dynamic Linkages for Prehensive Unity

## 1. Overview

**Story ID:** E5_F1_S2
**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F1 - Phase-Locked Progression & Triadic Flow Dynamics
**Project:** Nara Mode Full Dev v1 (Epi-Logos)
**Objective:** Implement specific dynamic linkages between the Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections of the Nara application. These linkages will ensure that user actions and insights (actual occasions of experience) in one section intelligently influence or unlock relevant features, prompts, or content (potential data for further prehension) in others, fostering a deeply interconnected nexus of occasions and facilitating a creative advance in the user's journey toward satisfaction (concrescence).

## 2. Story Definition

**As a** User (an experiencing subject whose journey is a process of concrescence),
**I want** actions and insights (actual occasions of experience) in one Nara section (Identity, Oracle, Journal) to be intelligently prehended by and influence or unlock relevant features, prompts, or content (potential data for further prehension) in the other sections,
**So that** my experience forms a deeply interconnected nexus of occasions, responsive to my evolving understanding and facilitating a creative advance in my journey toward satisfaction.

## 3. Technical Context & Design Philosophy

*   **Focus:** Implementing specific, intelligent connections between Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal.
*   **Prehensive Unity:** The core idea is that each interaction (actual occasion) is prehended by other parts of the system, creating a responsive dialogue and a society of occasions.
*   **Dynamic Unlocking/Suggestion:** Actions in one area can unlock specialized features (e.g., Oracle spreads) or generate context-aware prompts (e.g., Journal prompts based on Oracle cards) in another.
*   **Building on E5_F1_S1:** This story extends the foundational flow with concrete, data-driven linkages.
*   **Philosophical Grounding:** Whitehead's process philosophy (actual occasions, prehension, concrescence, subjective aim, satisfaction, eternal objects, society of occasions), fostering a living system that mirrors the user's evolving consciousness.

## 4. Constraints and Challenges

*   **Complexity of Linkage Logic:** Defining the rules and conditions for when and how linkages are triggered.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Nara agent needs to accurately interpret the significance of user actions (e.g., "significant updates" to Identity) to trigger relevant linkages.
*   **Contextual Relevance:** Ensuring that unlocked features or suggested prompts are genuinely relevant to the user's current state and prior actions.
*   **Avoiding Overwhelm:** Balancing helpful, dynamic suggestions with the risk of making the interface feel too busy or prescriptive.
*   **Subtlety of Indication:** Clearly indicating new possibilities without being intrusive.
*   **Time-Released Prompts:** Managing the logic for prompts that appear after a delay (e.g., for deeper integration of Oracle insights).

2.  **E5_F1_S1 Design Document:** Details of the core concrescence rhythm UI/UX flow.
3.  **Detailed Specifications for Identity Dynamics:** Including definable elements like intentions, challenges, values, Mahamaya Ground visualization aspects.
4.  **Catalogue of Oracle Spreads & Reading Modes (from Epic 2):** With descriptions of their purpose and typical use cases.
5.  **Journaling System Capabilities (from Epic 3):** How prompts are managed, how themes might be identified (even if manually by user initially).
6.  **Nara Agent Logic (Epic 4):** How Nara processes user input, stores user data, and makes decisions for `ag-ui` communication.
7.  **`ag-ui` Protocol Specification.**
8.  **Example Linkage Scenarios (beyond those in AC):**
    *   *Scenario A:* User defines a "Shadow Aspect" in Identity Dynamics. Nara suggests a "Confronting the Shadow" Oracle spread.
    *   *Scenario B:* An Oracle reading heavily features "Swords" (intellect/conflict). Journal prompts focus on analyzing recent mental struggles.

## 6. Expected Outputs from AI Builder (Design & Implementation Plan for Dynamic Linkages)

1.  **Detailed Linkage Matrix/Ruleset:**
    *   A comprehensive specification of all planned dynamic linkages:
        *   **Trigger:** Specific user action/input in Section A (e.g., updating 'core intention' in Identity).
        *   **Condition:** Any additional criteria (e.g., 'core intention' field was previously empty or significantly changed).
        *   **Action:** What happens in Section B (e.g., unlock 'Intention Seeker' Oracle spread; generate Journal prompt: 'How does this new intention feel?').
        *   **Notification:** How the user is informed (e.g., badge on Oracle icon, toast message).
2.  **Nara Agent Logic for Linkage Management (Backend):**
    *   How Nara will detect trigger events from frontend interactions (via `ag-ui`).
    *   How Nara will evaluate conditions and decide to activate a linkage.
    *   How Nara will communicate the activated linkage (e.g., new prompt, unlocked feature flag) back to the frontend via `ag-ui`.
3.  **Frontend Implementation Plan for Linkages:**
    *   How the frontend will send relevant interaction data to Nara.
    *   How the frontend will receive and process linkage activation messages from Nara.
    *   UI components for displaying notifications/indicators of new suggestions or unlocked content.
    *   Logic for dynamically altering UI elements (e.g., enabling a new Oracle spread option, populating a specific Journal prompt).
4.  **Design for Time-Released Journal Prompts:**
    *   Mechanism for scheduling and triggering these prompts (could be backend-driven with frontend display logic).
5.  **UI/UX for Linkage Indicators:** Mockups and specifications for subtle badges, contextual notifications, or other visual cues.
6.  **Configuration Options Design (If Applicable):** UI for allowing users to manage linkage sensitivity or types.
7.  **Error Handling:** How the system handles cases where linkage data is missing or processing fails.

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As an AI Systems Architect and Process Philosopher, with deep expertise in designing interconnected, emergent systems (inspired by Whitehead's metaphysics of prehension and concrescence) and user-centric interfaces, you are tasked with detailing the implementation of dynamic linkages within the Nara application, as per User Story E5_F1_S2.

This story builds upon a foundational UI flow (E5_F1_S1) that guides users through Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections. Your task is to design specific, intelligent connections where actions and insights (actual occasions) in one section are prehended by and dynamically influence or unlock relevant features, prompts, or content (potential data for prehension) in the others. The goal is to create a deeply interconnected nexus of occasions, making Nara feel like a living system responsive to the user's evolving journey toward satisfaction (concrescence).

Based on the provided story, the E5_F1_S1 design, specifications for Identity/Oracle/Journal sections, Nara agent capabilities, and the `ag-ui` protocol, deliver a comprehensive design and implementation plan for these dynamic linkages:

1.  **Detailed Linkage Matrix/Ruleset:** Create a comprehensive specification mapping trigger events in one section (e.g., Identity update) to specific actions in another (e.g., unlock Oracle spread, generate Journal prompt), including conditions and user notification methods.
2.  **Nara Agent Logic for Linkage Management (Backend):** Detail how Nara will detect triggers, evaluate conditions, and communicate activated linkages (new prompts, unlocked features) to the frontend via `ag-ui`.
3.  **Frontend Implementation Plan for Linkages:** Describe how the frontend sends interaction data, receives linkage activations, and dynamically updates UI elements (e.g., enabling options, displaying prompts/notifications).
4.  **Design for Time-Released Journal Prompts:** Specify the mechanism for scheduling and triggering prompts that appear after a delay for deeper integration.
5.  **UI/UX for Linkage Indicators:** Provide mockups/specifications for subtle visual cues (badges, contextual notifications) informing the user of new possibilities.
6.  **Configuration Options Design (If Applicable):** Propose UI for user control over linkage sensitivity/types.
7.  **Error Handling:** Outline how to manage potential issues in linkage data or processing.

Your design must transform Nara into a dynamic society of occasions, where each user interaction is a prehension contributing to a richer, more responsive, and ultimately more satisfying concrescence of meaning for the user.
