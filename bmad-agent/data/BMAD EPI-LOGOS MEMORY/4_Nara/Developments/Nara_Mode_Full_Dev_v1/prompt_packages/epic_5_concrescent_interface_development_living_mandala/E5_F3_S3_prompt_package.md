# AI Builder Prompt Package: E5_F3_S3 - Concrescence Phase Indicators: Opacity/Transparency

**Project:** Nara Concrescent Interface Development
**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F3 - Concrescence Phase Indicators
**Story ID:** E5_F3_S3 - Develop Concrescence Phase Indicators: Opacity/Transparency as Veiling/Unveiling of Potential

## 1. Context Overview

This prompt package is for designing and planning the implementation of a subtle UI feature in Nara: dynamic changes in the opacity or transparency of selected non-critical UI elements. These changes will serve as an ambient indicator of the user's current phase within a 12-fold concrescence cycle. The core idea is to reflect the philosophical concept of "veiling/unveiling of potential" â€“ how different phases of becoming (concrescence) involve varying degrees of definiteness versus openness to potentiality (Lila, Spanda, Cit-Shakti).

## 2. Story Definition (from E5_F3_S3)

**As a** User (Pramata, an experiencing subject navigating the interplay of the manifest and unmanifest),
**I want** the opacity or transparency of certain non-critical UI elements (e.g., background layers, decorative elements, perhaps hinting at the Mahamaya ground) to subtly change (e.g., more translucent during dissolution/contemplative phases where potentiality is high and forms are less defined; more solid during integration/focused work where specific actual occasions achieve definite satisfaction),
**So that** I receive a further ambient cue (a subtle prehension of the shifting veils of Lila) about my current phase within a 12-fold concrescence cycle, adding to the UI's dynamic and responsive nature as a field for the psyche's unfolding (Spanda).

## 3. Technical & Philosophical Context

*   **UI/UX Focus:** The primary goal is to enhance the user's ambient awareness of their psycho-spiritual rhythm through subtle, non-intrusive visual cues.
*   **12-Fold Concrescence Rhythm:** The opacity changes are directly tied to a 12-phase model of concrescence, representing a cycle of becoming or experience.
*   **Intuitive Awareness:** The effect should be felt more than explicitly noticed, contributing to an intuitive sense of the current phase's quality (e.g., openness, definition, dissolution, integration).
*   **Symbolic Opacity Mapping:** The core design challenge is to map phases to opacity levels in a way that symbolically reflects the interplay of manifest form and unmanifest potential.
*   **Philosophical Grounding:** The feature draws on concepts like Pramata (experiencing subject), Lila (divine play), Spanda (creative pulsation), Cit-Shakti (consciousness-power), Unus Mundus (unified reality), and Whiteheadian prehensions (how actual occasions grasp and integrate data from their environment).

## 4. Constraints & Design Challenges

*   **Defining Phase-to-Opacity Mapping:** Establishing a meaningful and intuitive correlation between each of the 12 phases and specific opacity/transparency characteristics (e.g., more translucent for phases emphasizing potentiality, more solid for phases emphasizing definiteness).
*   **Subtlety vs. Perceptibility:** Changes must be subtle enough not to distract but noticeable enough to provide an ambient cue.
*   **Aesthetic Harmony:** Opacity shifts must integrate seamlessly with the overall UI aesthetics and other dynamic elements (like Mahamaya motifs, color temperature, typographic weight).
*   **Readability & Usability:** Core interactive elements, primary text, and essential information must *always* maintain full readability and usability. Opacity changes apply *only* to non-critical, often decorative or background, elements.
*   **Smooth Transitions:** Animations between opacity states must be smooth and unobtrusive.
*   **System Awareness:** Relies on Nara's ability to track or infer the user's current concrescence phase.
*   **Selective Application:** Careful selection of UI elements that can afford to have their opacity modulated without impacting core functionality.
*   **Performance:** Opacity changes, especially if animated, should not degrade UI performance.
*   **User Controllability (Optional):** Consideration for allowing users to adjust intensity or disable the feature.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring changes do not negatively impact users with visual sensitivities; maintaining sufficient contrast for essential elements.
*   **Harmonization:** Must work in concert with E5_F3_S1 (Color Temperature) and E5_F3_S2 (Typographic Weight).

## 7. Prompt for Generative AI

```
As an expert UI/UX designer and frontend strategist specializing in ambient, philosophically-grounded interfaces, you are tasked with designing the "Opacity/Transparency as Veiling/Unveiling of Potential" feature for the Nara application, as detailed in Story E5_F3_S3.

**Objective:** Develop a system where the opacity/transparency of selected non-critical UI elements subtly shifts to reflect the user's current phase in a 12-fold concrescence cycle. This should provide an ambient, intuitive cue about the interplay between manifest form and unmanifest potential, enhancing the UI's dynamic and responsive nature.

**Given Inputs (assume access to):**
1.  The full User Story E5_F3_S3.
2.  A detailed 12-phase concrescence cycle model (describing the quality of each phase, e.g., Phase 1: Initial Receptivity - high potential, low definition; Phase 6: Peak Integration - high definition, focused energy; Phase 12: Dissolution & Release - fading forms, return to potential).
3.  Nara's UI style guide, component library, and examples of non-critical decorative/background elements (e.g., subtle background patterns, ethereal geometric overlays, Mahamaya ground hints).
4.  Specifications for related indicators: E5_F3_S1 (Color Temperature) and E5_F3_S2 (Typographic Weight).

**Produce the Following Outputs (as detailed in Section 6 of the Prompt Package E5_F3_S3_prompt_package.md):

1.  **Phase-to-Opacity/Transparency Mapping Specification:** Create a clear mapping for all 12 phases to opacity values/states for designated element types. Justify each choice based on the phase's nature (potential vs. actuality, veiling vs. unveiling).
    *   *Example Detail Level:* "Phase 1 (Initial Receptivity): Background decorative elements at 30% opacity (highly translucent) to signify openness to potential. Mahamaya ground hints at 20% opacity, very subtle." "Phase 6 (Peak Integration): Background decorative elements at 80% opacity (semi-solid) to signify focused form. Mahamaya ground hints at 60% opacity, more present."

2.  **Visual Design Mockups/Prototypes:** Provide visual examples (static or described for animation) for at least 3 distinct phases, showing how opacity changes affect different non-critical elements. Emphasize subtlety and aesthetic appeal. Describe the intended 'feel'.

3.  **Transition Design Specifications:** Define how opacity transitions between phases should occur (e.g., duration, easing functions) to ensure smoothness.

4.  **UI Element Selection Guidelines & Examples:** Provide clear rules for choosing which elements can have their opacity changed, ensuring no impact on essential UI components or text readability. Give examples of suitable and unsuitable elements.

5.  **Frontend Implementation Plan & Considerations:** Briefly outline technical approaches for implementation (CSS/JS) and key performance considerations (e.g., use of `opacity` vs. `rgba`, hardware acceleration).

6.  **Harmonization Strategy with Other Indicators:** Explain how these opacity shifts will complement and work harmoniously with the planned color temperature and typographic weight changes, creating a cohesive set of ambient cues.

7.  **Performance Impact Analysis:** Briefly discuss potential performance issues and how to mitigate them.

8.  **User Control Design (Optional but Recommended):** Sketch or describe simple user controls for adjusting the intensity or toggling this feature.

9.  **Accessibility Review & Guidelines:** Outline key accessibility considerations, especially regarding contrast and legibility if any text is near or on elements with modulated opacity.

**Focus on:**
*   **Philosophical Resonance:** Ensure the design choices deeply reflect the story's intent of "veiling/unveiling potential."
*   **Subtlety and Ambience:** The effect should be felt, not overtly distracting.
*   **Practicality:** Solutions should be implementable and performant.
*   **Holistic Integration:** Consider how this feature fits within the broader Nara UI and its other dynamic elements.
