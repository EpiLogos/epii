# User Story: E2_F4_S1 - Oracle UI for Archetypal Decan Exploration (Jungian & Saivist Informed)

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F4 - User Interface for Decanic Exploration
**Story ID:** E2_F4_S1

**As a** User interacting with the Oracle section, seeking to understand the deeper archetypal currents at play (informed by Jungian psychology and with subtle hints of Kashmir Saivism),
**I want** an intuitive user interface that allows me to easily explore the decanic associations (as facets of archetypal fields) of drawn cards, how these resonate with my natal psyche's blueprint (relevant natal placements), and how current cosmic energies (transits) are activating these themes,
**So that** I can deepen my understanding of the decanic context as a mirror to my inner world, its personal relevance to my individuation journey, and the interconnectedness of all phenomena (as expressions of a single Consciousness).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Clear Display of Card's Archetypal Decan:** Building on E2_F1_S1, the primary decanic association of the drawn card (e.g., "Venus in Scorpio, 3rd Decan â€“ Archetype of [Specific Decanic Archetype]") must be clearly and prominently displayed, framing it as a specific archetypal energy.
2.  **Interactive Archetypal Decan Insights:** Users should be able to click/tap on the displayed decan information (or a dedicated icon) to access more details, presented in a way that encourages psychological reflection:
    *   Ruling planet(s) of the decan (as archetypal principles).
    *   Zodiac sign and modality/element (as fundamental psychic energies).
    *   Traditional and archetypal imagery or symbols associated with the decan (from `bimba_map` or other sources), inviting symbolic interpretation.
    *   A brief description of the decan's general themes and archetypal energies, hinting at its role in the psyche's unfolding and its connection to broader consciousness.
3.  **Natal Psyche Resonance:** If the user's natal chart (from E2_F1_S3, understood as their psyche's blueprint) has significant placements in the drawn card's decan (or aspecting its archetypal ruler), these should be visually highlighted or summarized in an accessible way within the decan exploration view (e.g., "Your Natal Sun, representing your core Self, resonates strongly with this Decan's archetypal field," or "Your Natal Mars, symbolizing your assertive drive, is in dynamic dialogue with the ruler of this Decan, Mercury, suggesting a focus on [interpretation related to individuation].").
4.  **Current Archetypal Activations (Transits):** Key current transits (from E2_F1_S2) relevant to the drawn card's decan (e.g., an archetypal planet currently transiting this decan, or aspecting its ruler) should be indicated, perhaps with a brief explanation of how these cosmic energies are currently activating this specific archetypal theme in the collective and potentially within the user's personal experience, offering opportunities for conscious engagement.
5.  **Intuitive Journey of Discovery:** The interface for exploring these layers of archetypal-decanic information should be intuitive, avoiding clutter and allowing users to easily navigate between the card's immediate symbolism, its general archetypal decanic meaning, its resonance with their natal psyche, and current archetypal activations (transits), fostering a sense of personal discovery and insight.
6.  **Symbolic Visual Language:** Use clear visual cues (icons, colors, typography) that are aesthetically pleasing and symbolically resonant to differentiate between the card's intrinsic archetypal decanic meaning, its connections to the user's natal psyche, and current transit activations, subtly reinforcing the interconnectedness of these layers.
7.  **Responsive Design:** The decanic exploration UI must be responsive and function effectively across various devices and screen sizes.
8.  **Accessibility:** Ensure the UI meets accessibility standards for readability and interaction.

**Dependencies:**

*   Story E2_F1_S1 (Dynamic Card Rendering) for basic decan display.
*   Story E2_F1_S2 (Real-Time Astro Integration) for transit data.
*   Story E2_F1_S3 (Natal Chart Cross-Referencing) for natal data.
*   Story E2_F3_S1 (Advanced Symbolic Synthesis Engine) to provide the structured data for display.
*   `bimba_map` for detailed decan imagery, descriptions, and correspondences.
*   UI/UX design mockups for the decanic exploration interface.

**Notes:**

*   This story focuses on the Oracle section's UI. Similar principles might apply to displaying decanic information in the Identity Dynamics section, but that would be a separate story if significantly different.
*   Consider using tooltips, expandable sections, or modal views to present detailed information without overwhelming the main reading display.
*   The goal is to make the rich symbolic and archetypal data accessible and understandable, empowering the user to explore the decanic layers as reflections of their own psyche and the wider field of consciousness, fostering self-awareness and a sense of participation in the cosmic dance (Lila).
