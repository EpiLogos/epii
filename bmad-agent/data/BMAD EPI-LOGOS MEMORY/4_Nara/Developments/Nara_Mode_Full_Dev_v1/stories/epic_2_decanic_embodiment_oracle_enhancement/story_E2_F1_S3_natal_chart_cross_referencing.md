# User Story: E2_F1_S3 - Natal Psyche Resonance: Oracle Guidance for Individuation

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F1 - Oracle Section Enhancement - Decanic Theater
**Story ID:** E2_F1_S3

**As a** User with a stored Natal Chart (my personal archetypal map) in my Mahamaya Ground,
**I want** Oracle guidance to be personalized by cross-referencing drawn cards and current transits (collective archetypal dynamics) with my unique natal placements (my psyche's inherent structure and potentials),
**So that** the insights are deeply relevant to my individuation journey, illuminating how current energies interact with my innate psychological patterns, shadow material, and the unfolding expression of my Self, revealing the unique way universal consciousness (Citi) plays through me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Natal Psyche Map Access:** The system must be able to access the user's stored natal chart data from their Mahamaya Ground, understood as a symbolic map of their psyche's foundational archetypes, complexes, and energetic patterns.
2.  **Archetypal Resonance Analysis:** Backend logic must be developed to:
    *   Identify if the decan of a drawn card (from E2_F1_S1, representing a specific archetypal field) resonates with or is significantly activated by the user's natal placements (e.g., natal Sun in the same decan suggesting a core identity theme, or natal Mars aspecting the decan's ruling planet indicating a dynamic tension or potential for action related to that archetype).
    *   Analyze how current transits (from E2_F1_S2, representing active collective unconscious energies) interact with the user's natal chart, particularly in relation to the drawn card's themes and its decanic ruler, highlighting potential areas of psychological activation, growth, or challenge.
    *   Consider aspects between transiting planets and natal planets as indicators of how broader archetypal forces are currently 'speaking' to the individual's unique psychic structure.
    *   Identify if the decan of a drawn card (from E2_F1_S1) resonates with or is activated by any of the user's natal placements (e.g., user has natal Sun in the same decan, or natal Mars aspecting the decan's ruling planet).
    *   Analyze how current transits (from E2_F1_S2) interact with the user's natal chart, particularly in relation to the drawn card's themes and its decanic ruler.
    *   Consider aspects between transiting planets and natal planets, especially those involving the card's ruling planet or planets in the card's sign/decan.
3.  **Individuation-Focused Interpretation Layer:** The Oracle interpretation should include a layer of personalization based on these natal chart cross-references. This could highlight:
    *   How a current situation or archetypal theme (represented by the card and transits) might specifically impact the user's psyche due to their natal predispositions, potentially bringing shadow aspects or latent potentials to light.
    *   Which inherent psychological strengths, sensitivities, or complexes (indicated by natal placements) might be activated or relevant for navigating the situation.
    *   How the card's archetypal energy manifests uniquely for the user, offering pointers for their specific path of individuation and self-realization.
    *   How a current situation (represented by the card and transits) might specifically impact the user due to their natal predispositions.
    *   Which natal strengths or challenges might be activated or relevant.
    *   How the card's energy manifests uniquely for the user.
4.  **UI Indication of Personal Resonance:** The UI should clearly indicate that the interpretation has been personalized, framing it as a reflection of the user's unique psycho-spiritual constitution. This could be a specific section in the reading (e.g., "Personal Resonance," "For Your Journey") or subtle visual cues that honor the individual's path.
5.  **Privacy and Consent:** Ensure user data privacy is maintained and that personalization is based on consent (implicitly through use of the feature, or explicitly).
6.  **Clarity & Depth of Personalized Insights:** The personalized aspects of the interpretation should be clear, insightful, and use psychologically resonant language, explaining any necessary symbolic terms in a way that fosters self-understanding and avoids deterministic pronouncements. The language should subtly affirm the user's capacity for growth and transformation.
7.  **Integration with Previous Stories:** This story builds upon E2_F1_S1 (decanic association) and E2_F1_S2 (real-time astrology). The natal cross-referencing should synthesize with these other layers.

**Dependencies:**

*   Completed User Onboarding (Epic 1, Feature 3) to ensure natal data is collected and stored in Mahamaya Ground.
*   Story E1_F1_S2 (Astrological Natal Chart Layer) for the structure and accessibility of natal chart data.
*   Story E2_F1_S1 (Dynamic Card Rendering) for card's decanic info.
*   Story E2_F1_S2 (Real-Time Astro Integration) for current transit data.
*   A sophisticated backend system (potentially involving the Parashakti Agent or Nara Agent, guided by Jungian and Saivist principles) capable of performing these astrological calculations and synthesizing psychologically nuanced insights that honor the complexity of the Self.

**Notes:**

*   The complexity of natal chart interpretation is vast. Initial implementation could focus on key natal placements (e.g., Sun, Moon, Ascendant, chart ruler, significant archetypal configurations like stelliums or major aspect patterns) or direct activations of the card's decan/ruler by natal planets, always aiming to illuminate aspects of the individuation process.
*   The goal is not to provide a full natal chart reading with every Oracle draw, but to add a relevant layer of personal context that supports the user's journey towards wholeness and self-recognition (Pratyabhijna).
*   Consider using the `bimba_map` to identify deeper symbolic connections between the card, its decan, current transits, and the user's natal energies, viewing these as interconnected expressions of a unified field of consciousness.
*   The goal is not to provide a full natal chart reading with every Oracle draw, but to add a relevant layer of personal context.
*   **Technical Considerations (New Section):**
    *   **Natal Archetype Profiling:** Develop a system to identify key archetypal themes, potential complexes, and individuation pathways suggested by the user's natal chart.
    *   **Dynamic Synthesis Engine:** Implement or enhance a synthesis engine that can weave together the card's meaning, its decanic archetype, current transiting archetypes, and the user's natal archetypal profile into a coherent and insightful narrative.
    *   **Reflective Prompts for Personal Integration:** Generate prompts that encourage the user to reflect on how these interconnected symbolic energies are playing out in their life and inner experience, fostering a deeper connection with their Self.
