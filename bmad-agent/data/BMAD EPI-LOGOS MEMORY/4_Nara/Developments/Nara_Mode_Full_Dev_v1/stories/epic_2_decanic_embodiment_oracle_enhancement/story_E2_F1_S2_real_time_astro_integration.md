# User Story: E2_F1_S2 - Real-Time Astro-Psychological Resonance for Oracle Insights

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F1 - Oracle Section Enhancement - Decanic Theater
**Story ID:** E2_F1_S2

**As a** User seeking to understand the deeper currents of my psyche through the Oracle,
**I want** the interpretations of drawn cards to be dynamically attuned to real-time astrological conditions (current planetary positions, planetary hours, moon phases), viewed as symbolic expressions of the collective unconscious and its archetypal dynamics,
**So that** the guidance I receive is more timely and resonates with the prevailing psycho-spiritual atmosphere, offering insights into how these broader energetic patterns (the play of Spanda) might be reflected in my personal experience and individuation journey.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Astro-Symbolic Data Integration:** The system must successfully integrate with an external or internal API to fetch real-time astrological data, which will be interpreted symbolically:
    *   Current zodiacal positions of all relevant planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron, Nodes).
    *   Current planetary hour and its ruling planet.
    *   Current moon phase (e.g., New Moon, Waxing Crescent, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous) and its sign.
2.  **Archetypal Resonance Logic:** Backend logic must be developed to weave base card interpretations with the symbolic meaning of fetched astrological data. This includes:
    *   Identifying significant transits as potential activators of specific archetypal themes or complexes.
    *   Considering the influence of the current planetary hour ruler on the thematic undercurrents of the psyche.
    *   Factoring in the current moon phase and its sign to color the emotional or cyclical context of the reading, relating it to phases of inner work (e.g., introspection, action, release).
    *   Identifying significant transits (e.g., a planet aspecting the decan's ruler, or a planet in the decan's sign).
    *   Considering the influence of the current planetary hour ruler on the reading's theme.
    *   Factoring in the current moon phase and its sign to color the emotional or cyclical context of the reading.
3.  **Display of Psycho-Spiritual Context:** The UI must subtly indicate or provide an option to view the key real-time astrological factors influencing the current interpretation, framed in psycho-spiritual terms (e.g., "Reading resonates with: Active Mars in Aries (Archetype of Initiative), Nurturing Waxing Moon in Taurus (Archetype of Embodied Growth), Expansive Jupiter Hour (Theme of Widening Perspectives)").
4.  **Meaningful Synthesis & Reflective Prompts:** The synthesized interpretation (card meaning + astrological-archetypal influence) must be coherent, insightful, and invite self-reflection. It should use accessible language, explaining any necessary symbolic terms and potentially offering prompts for deeper contemplation on how these energies manifest personally.
5.  **Performance:** API calls for astrological data should be efficient and not unduly delay the presentation of the Oracle reading.
6.  **Accuracy of Astrological Data & Symbolic Integrity:** The fetched astrological data must be accurate. The symbolic interpretation of this data must maintain integrity with established astrological and psychological principles, while hinting at the underlying unity of consciousness.
7.  **Fallback Mechanism & Transparency:** If the astrological data service is unavailable, the system should gracefully fall back to providing standard card interpretations (as per E2_F1_S1), possibly with a notification to the user about the current scope of interpretation, emphasizing the inherent wisdom of the card itself.

**Dependencies:**

*   Reliable astrological calculation API/service.
*   Defined base interpretations for each Tarot card.
*   Story E2_F1_S1 (Dynamic Card Rendering) for base card display.
*   A system for defining how specific astrological conditions resonate with or modulate card meanings and archetypal themes (this could be a rules engine, a knowledge base of symbolic correspondences, or LLM-driven interpretation guided by Jungian and Saivist perspectives).

**Notes:**

*   The depth of astrological-psychological influence can be iterative. Initial implementation might focus on major transits or the planetary hour, with more nuanced integrations (e.g., considering dignities, aspects to fixed stars with known archetypal links) added later.
*   Consider how to present this layered information without overwhelming the user. Progressive disclosure, perhaps leading to deeper reflective content, might be a good UX pattern to encourage contemplation of the Self's multifaceted expression.
*   This story focuses on *general* real-time astrological conditions as reflections of the collective psyche. Personalization based on the user's *natal chart* (the individual's unique imprint of these archetypal energies) is covered in E2_F1_S3.
*   Consider how to present this layered information without overwhelming the user. Progressive disclosure might be a good UX pattern.
*   **Technical Considerations (New Section):**
    *   **Archetypal Mapping for Astrological Events:** Develop or integrate a system for mapping current astrological events (planets in signs, aspects, moon phases, planetary hours) to Jungian archetypes, psychological functions, or relevant themes for individuation.
    *   **Dynamic Text Generation for Insights:** Implement a mechanism (template-based, rule-based, or LLM-assisted) to generate concise, insightful text that bridges the card's meaning with the current astrological-archetypal context.
    *   **UI for Reflective Engagement:** Design the UI to present this information not just as data, but as an invitation to explore the synchronistic interplay between inner and outer worlds, fostering a sense of connection to the larger patterns of consciousness.
