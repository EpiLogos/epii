# User Story: E2_F2_S1 - Archetypal Sustenance: Decanically-Aligned Nutritional Wisdom

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F2 - Identity Dynamics Integration - Decanic Lifestyle
**Story ID:** E2_F2_S1

**As a** User exploring my Identity Dynamics and seeking to live in greater harmony with my psycho-spiritual nature,
**I want** to receive practical, decanically-informed nutrition suggestions based on my natal Venus placement (as a symbol of my core values, pleasure principle, and the Anima/Animus dynamics in relation to sustenance) and current significant decanic influences (reflecting prevailing archetypal energies in the collective unconscious and their subtle vibratory signatures),
**So that** I can align my dietary choices with supportive archetypal energies for holistic well-being, pleasure, and the integration of unconscious aspects, recognizing food as a carrier of symbolic and energetic information that participates in the constant play of consciousness (Spanda).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Natal Venus Archetype Access:** The system must access the user's natal Venus sign and decan (if available/calculable) from their Mahamaya Ground, interpreting it as a key to their innate patterns of relating to pleasure, nourishment, and the receptive (Yin/Shakti) aspects of their psyche.
2.  **Current Archetypal Climate (Decanic):** The system must identify current significant decanic influences, understood as shifts in the collective archetypal field. This could be based on:
    *   The Sun's current decan (symbolizing the conscious ego's current focus and expression).
    *   The Moon's current decan (reflecting the ebb and flow of the emotional body and unconscious patterns).
    *   Other astrologically significant transiting planets activating specific decans, indicating potent archetypal dynamics at play.
    *   The Sun's current decan.
    *   The Moon's current decan.
    *   Other astrologically significant transiting planets activating specific decans.
3.  **Archetype-Nourishment Correspondence Logic:** A knowledge base (potentially within `bimba_map` or a dedicated module informed by traditional wisdom and symbolic understanding) must exist that maps:
    *   Zodiac signs and decans (as specific archetypal fields) to types of foods, herbs, spices, or dietary principles that resonate with their symbolic qualities (e.g., Venus in Taurus decan might suggest foods that evoke grounding, sensual pleasure, and connection to the Earth Mother archetype; Mars-ruled decans might suggest foods that support assertiveness and the mobilization of psychic energy).
    *   Planetary rulers of decans (as archetypal functions) to associated food qualities and their subtle energetic (pranic) effects, hinting at the food's role in the dance of universal energies.
    *   Zodiac signs and decans to types of foods, herbs, spices, or dietary principles (e.g., Venus in Taurus decan might suggest grounding, pleasure-oriented foods; Mars-ruled decans might suggest warming or energizing foods).
    *   Planetary rulers of decans to associated food qualities.
4.  **Personalized Archetypal Sustenance Guidance:** The system must generate personalized nutrition suggestions by synthesizing:
    *   The user's natal Venus archetype (indicating inherent psycho-energetic needs and preferences related to nourishment and the integration of the feeling function).
    *   Current prevailing decanic energies (offering opportunities to consciously engage with active archetypal themes through dietary choices).
    *   The user's natal Venus placement (indicating inherent preferences and needs related to pleasure, receptivity, and values in diet).
    *   Current prevailing decanic energies.
5.  **UI Display for Conscious Consumption:** The generated nutrition suggestions should be displayed in a dedicated section within the user's Identity Dynamics dashboard, framed as invitations to mindful eating.
    *   Suggestions should be practical and actionable, encouraging a conscious connection with the food (e.g., "Consider incorporating more leafy greens this week as the Sun transits a Mercury-ruled decan, supporting mental clarity and the assimilation of new insights," or "With your natal Venus in Libra, explore balanced and aesthetically pleasing meals that nourish your inner sense of harmony. Currently, with Jupiter influencing the active decan, consider foods that evoke a sense of joyful expansion and gratitude.").
    *   Suggestions should be practical and actionable (e.g., "Consider incorporating more leafy greens this week as the Sun transits a Mercury-ruled decan," or "With your natal Venus in Libra, explore balanced and aesthetically pleasing meals. Currently, with Jupiter influencing the active decan, consider expansive flavors.").
6.  **Symbolic Rationale & Reflective Prompts:** Suggestions should be accompanied by a brief, clear rationale explaining the archetypal/decanic connection (e.g., "Venus in [Sign/Dekan] often finds resonance with...", "The current [Planet] in [Sign/Dekan] influence invites an attunement to energies that support..."). Include subtle prompts for reflection, e.g., "How might this food support your current process of individuation?"
7.  **Invitational & Empowering Tone:** Suggestions should be framed as invitations for exploration and self-discovery, not rigid dietary rules, respecting individual dietary needs, restrictions, and the user's autonomy in their journey towards wholeness. The aim is to foster a conscious relationship with food as a form of self-awareness and participation in the flow of life energy.
8.  **Link to Further Exploration (Optional):** Potentially link to more detailed articles or resources about decanic nutrition or specific foods/herbs mentioned.

**Dependencies:**

*   Completed User Onboarding (Epic 1, Feature 3) for natal Venus data.
*   Story E1_F4_S1 (Identity Dynamics Dashboard) for the UI container.
*   Access to real-time astrological data to determine current decanic influences (similar to E2_F1_S2).
*   A developed knowledge base of decan-food-archetype correspondences, potentially drawing from Ayurveda, TCM, traditional herbalism, and symbolic interpretations, all viewed as different languages describing the same underlying energetic reality.

**Notes:**

*   This feature is about offering gentle, astrologically-inspired dietary nudges, not medical advice. A clear disclaimer should be included.
*   The specificity of suggestions can evolve. Initial versions might offer broader themes, while later versions could suggest specific ingredients or simple recipe ideas.
*   The `bimba_map` could be crucial for storing and querying the complex relationships between planets, signs, decans, their associated archetypal themes (e.g., Jungian archetypes, alchemical symbolism), and their corresponding dietary/herbal qualities, recognizing these connections as part of the web of consciousness.
*   **Technical Considerations (New Section):**
    *   **Archetypal Food Database:** Design a flexible database schema to store food items, their properties (e.g., warming/cooling, grounding/uplifting), and their symbolic associations with decans, planets, and Jungian archetypes.
    *   **Personalized Recommendation Engine:** Develop an algorithm that considers natal Venus, current transits, and user preferences (if any) to generate relevant and resonant suggestions.
    *   **Content for Reflective Prompts:** Curate or generate brief, insightful prompts that encourage users to reflect on the symbolic meaning of their food choices and their connection to their inner world and the subtle energies around them.
