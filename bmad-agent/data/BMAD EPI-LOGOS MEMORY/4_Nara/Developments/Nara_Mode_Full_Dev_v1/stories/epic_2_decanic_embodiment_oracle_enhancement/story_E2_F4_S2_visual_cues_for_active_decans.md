# User Story: E2_F4_S2 - Visual Cues for Active Archetypal Decanic Resonances in Oracle UI (Jungian & Saivist Informed)

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F4 - User Interface for Decanic Exploration
**Story ID:** E2_F4_S2

**As a** User receiving an Oracle reading, seeking to perceive the subtle currents of archetypal energy and consciousness (informed by Jungian psychology and Kashmir Saivism),
**I want** clear, aesthetically resonant visual cues within the Oracle interface that highlight the currently most active or significant decanic archetypal influences impacting my reading (based on the drawn card's symbolism, real-time astrological activations, and my natal psyche's attunement),
**So that** I can quickly grasp the primary archetypal themes and focal points of consciousness (Spanda) seeking expression and integration through the guidance being offered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Identification of Key Archetypal Decanic Resonances:** The backend (leveraging E2_F3_S1 - Advanced Symbolic Synthesis Engine for Archetypal Integration) must identify and prioritize the most significant archetypal decanic influences for the current reading, reflecting points of potent psychic energy. This could include:
    *   The archetypal field of the drawn Tarot card's decan.
    *   A decan whose archetypal theme is strongly activated by a current potent transit, indicating a collective or personal psychic weather pattern.
    *   A decan that is particularly resonant with the user's natal psyche (natal chart) in the context of the reading, highlighting an active aspect of their individuation journey.
2.  **Illuminative Visual Highlighting:** The Oracle UI must implement a system of aesthetically harmonious and symbolically rich visual cues to gently draw attention to these key archetypal decanic influences. Examples include:
    *   Subtle glows, luminous borders, or color accents on the drawn card if its decan's archetypal field is primary, suggesting its energetic radiance.
    *   Elegant icons or symbols representing the ruling archetypal planet or element of the most active decan, displayed prominently but unobtrusively, hinting at the essential qualities at play.
    *   A small, dedicated "Current Archetypal Resonances" panel summarizing the top 1-3 decanic themes with associated evocative visual symbols, inviting deeper contemplation.
    *   If a zodiacal wheel or similar astrological graphic is part of the UI, highlighting the active decan(s) on it with a sense of living energy.
3.  **Clarity, Beauty, and Unobtrusiveness:** Visual cues should be noticeable enough to convey archetypal significance but designed with beauty and subtlety, so they enhance rather than detract from the contemplative quality of the reading experience or the card's imaginal depth.
4.  **Symbolic Consistency:** The visual language used for these cues should be consistent with the overall UI design and the symbolic visual language established in E2_F4_S1 for archetypal decan exploration, creating a cohesive and meaningful aesthetic.
5.  **Dynamic Reflection of Consciousness:** Visual cues should update dynamically, reflecting the fluid nature of consciousness and archetypal interplay if the context changes (e.g., if the user draws another card or if a significant astrological event like a planetary hour change occurs mid-session, if the system is designed for such real-time updates).
6.  **Invitational Tooltips/Hover Info (Optional):** Hovering over a visual cue could provide a brief, evocative tooltip explaining the archetypal decanic influence it represents (e.g., "The dynamic, initiatory energy of the Mars in Aries decan is currently highlighted, inviting courageous self-expression.").
7.  **Accessibility:** Ensure visual cues are designed with accessibility in mind (e.g., sufficient contrast, not relying solely on color for meaning).

**Dependencies:**

*   Story E2_F3_S1 (Advanced Symbolic Synthesis Engine) to identify and prioritize the key active decanic influences.
*   Story E2_F4_S1 (Oracle UI for Decanic Exploration) as this story builds upon and enhances that UI.
*   UI/UX design mockups specifying the appearance and behavior of these visual cues.

**Notes:**

*   The goal is to provide an at-a-glance intuitive sense of the dominant archetypal decanic energies at play, inviting the user into a deeper recognition of these patterns within themselves and the moment.
*   This feature helps to make the complex archetypal synthesis performed by the backend more immediately and intuitively apparent to the user, fostering a felt sense of connection to these subtle realities.
*   The "most active" archetypal decanic influences might be determined by a resonance scoring system within the synthesis engine, reflecting their significance in the current constellation of consciousness.
*   Consider how these cues integrate with the Bodily Resonance Mapping (E2_F1_S4) if that feature is active, potentially highlighting corresponding areas on the somatic-energetic body map, further emphasizing the embodiment of these archetypal energies.
