# User Story: E2_F1_S4 - Somatic Archetypes: Mapping Decanic Energies to the Felt Sense

**Epic:** 2 - Decanic Embodiment & Oracle Enhancement
**Feature:** F1 - Oracle Section Enhancement - Decanic Theater
**Story ID:** E2_F1_S4

**As a** User seeking to integrate Oracle guidance into my felt experience and deepen my somatic awareness of psychological processes,
**I want** to see card imagery and their decanic symbols visually mapped or projected onto relevant energetic centers or areas of the human form (e.g., chakras, key somatic points, areas associated with specific psychological functions or Human Design bodygraph concepts), representing the body as a field of consciousness,
**So that** I can gain a more direct, visceral, and visually clear sense of where these archetypal energies might be resonating within my somatic experience, fostering a deeper connection between mind, body, and psyche, and recognizing these sensations as manifestations of the underlying vibratory nature of reality (Spanda).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Somatic-Energetic Body Model:** A visual representation of the human form with key energetic centers and/or somatic regions (e.g., a simplified chakra system, a Human Design bodygraph outline, or a generic body map that can highlight areas associated with psychological functions like thinking, feeling, intuition, sensation) must be available in the UI. This model serves as a canvas for exploring the felt sense of archetypal energies.
2.  **Archetype-Soma Correspondence Logic:** A system (potentially leveraging the `bimba_map` and informed by psycho-somatic principles) must be developed to determine correspondences between:
    *   Specific Tarot cards (as archetypal situations) and relevant energetic centers or somatic regions where their themes might be felt or processed.
    *   Specific decans (and their ruling planets/signs, as nuanced archetypal influences) and corresponding areas of bodily or psychological resonance.
    *   Relevant pranic channels or body parts associated with the card/decan's symbolism, viewed through a lens of embodied psychology (e.g., how certain tensions or flows might relate to specific psychological states).
    *   Specific Tarot cards and energetic centers.
    *   Specific decans (and their ruling planets/signs) and energetic centers.
    *   Relevant pranic channels or body parts associated with the card/decan's symbolism.
3.  **Somatic Resonance Visualization:** When a card is drawn and its decanic-archetypal association is identified (from E2_F1_S1):
    *   The UI should offer an option to view its 'Somatic Resonance Map' or 'Embodied Archetype View'.
    *   Upon activation, relevant card symbols, decanic glyphs, color codes, or subtle animations should be visually overlaid or highlighted on the corresponding energetic centers/somatic regions of the body model, suggesting potential areas of inner awareness or felt sense.
    *   The UI should offer an option to view its 'Bodily Resonance Map'.
    *   Upon activation, relevant card symbols, decanic glyphs, or color codes should be visually overlaid or highlighted on the corresponding energetic centers of the body model.
4.  **Reflective Somatic Prompts:** Users should be able to hover over or click on highlighted centers/regions to get more information about the connection, framed as an invitation to inner inquiry (e.g., "The 5 of Cups, linked to Venus in Scorpio's 3rd decan, often resonates with the Sacral Chakra area. Notice any sensations or feelings here related to emotional processing, desire, or relational dynamics. How does this archetypal energy feel in your body right now?").
5.  **Clarity, Aesthetics, and Intuitive Embodiment:** The visual mapping should be clear, aesthetically pleasing, and intuitively guide the user towards somatic awareness rather than purely intellectual analysis. The goal is to facilitate a felt understanding of how archetypal energies might manifest in the body, supporting the integration of unconscious material.
6.  **Personalized Somatic Resonance (Future Consideration):** While initial mapping might be general (based on common archetypal-somatic correspondences), future iterations could personalize the mapping based on the user's specific Human Design, natal chart emphasis (e.g., a strong earth element emphasis might highlight different somatic connections), or even user-reported felt senses, further tailoring the journey of recognizing the Self in its embodied form.
7.  **UI Integration:** The feature should be well-integrated into the Oracle section, perhaps as an expandable view or a separate tab related to the drawn card.

**Dependencies:**

*   Story E2_F1_S1 (Dynamic Card Rendering) to identify the card and its decan.
*   A dataset or logic within `bimba_map` (or a dedicated somatic correspondence engine) defining correspondences between symbolic elements (cards, decans, planets, signs, associated Jungian archetypes) and energetic centers/somatic regions, drawing from traditions like yoga, TCM, Human Design, and somatic psychology, all viewed as expressions of a unified conscious energy.
*   UI/UX design for the body map visualization and the overlay/projection mechanism.

**Notes:**

*   This feature is exploratory and aims to enhance the *embodied* experience. The level of detail can be iterative.
*   Consider using simplified iconography or color-coding to represent the energies on the body map to maintain clarity.
*   If AR (Augmented Reality) is pursued in the future, this feature could be a foundational element for projecting symbols onto the user's actual body via a camera feed, but this story focuses on an in-app 2D representation first.
*   The term "Human Design inspired body-mapping" suggests drawing from its concepts of centers, gates, and channels as a way to understand the body's energetic blueprint and its connection to psychological functions. This story might focus on a simplified version or key resonant points that align with broader psycho-somatic principles, hinting at the body as a microcosm of the universal play of consciousness.
*   **Technical Considerations (New Section):**
    *   **Somatic Correspondence Database/Logic:** Develop a robust system for mapping archetypal energies to somatic experiences, potentially allowing for multiple layers of correspondence (e.g., chakra, elemental, organ system, psychological function area).
    *   **Interactive Body Visualization:** Implement a dynamic and responsive visual model of the human form that can clearly display highlighted areas and associated information.
    *   **Guided Somatic Inquiry Prompts:** Create a library of prompts designed to guide users in exploring the felt sense of the highlighted archetypal energies, encouraging mindfulness and interoception as part of the individuation process.
