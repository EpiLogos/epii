# User Story: E4_F1_S1 - Nara Agent Foundation: Core Orchestration for Individuation and Conscious Play

**Epic:** 4 - Nara Agent Core & Coordination: The Orchestrating Intelligence
**Feature:** F1 - Nara Agent Development
**Story ID:** E4_F1_S1

**As a** System Architect developing the Nara agent within a framework integrating Jungian psychology with subtle insights from Kashmir Saivism,
**I want** to implement the foundational Nara Prime agent with core functionalities including user session management (tracking the user's individuation journey and evolving self-awareness – Pramata), state tracking (aware of the user's engagement with archetypal content and resonance with deeper vibrational realities – Spanda), receiving and processing UI input via the ag-ui protocol, and basic orchestration capabilities for future sub-agent interaction (initially focusing on interaction with the `epii` agent for philosophical depth and `bimba_map` access for symbolic connections reflecting both archetypal patterns and the unity of consciousness – Paramashiva),
**So that** Nara can serve as the central intelligence, managing user interactions and coordinating data synthesis in a way that supports the user's self-discovery, integration of unconscious material, and recognition of their inherent creative potency (Cit-Shakti) and the Self (Atman), reflecting a coherent, Jungian-informed and subtly Saivist-aware user experience that acknowledges the cosmic play (Lila).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **User Session Management:**
    *   Nara can initiate, maintain, and terminate user sessions.
    *   Session data (e.g., user ID, current context, interaction history) is securely stored and retrievable.
2.  **State Tracking (Jungian & Saivist Context):**
    *   The agent can track the user's current state within the application (e.g., active section like Oracle or Journal, current view, ongoing interactions), interpreting this state in the context of their engagement with symbolic material relevant to Jungian concepts (e.g., archetypal encounters, shadow work, alchemical stages of transformation) and moments of Saivist resonance (e.g., recognition of Spanda, flashes of Pratibha/insight).
3.  **AG-UI Protocol Integration (Receiving Input):**
    *   Nara can successfully receive structured messages from the UI via the `ag-ui` protocol.
    *   Messages should include user input, UI context (e.g., current screen, selected elements), and any relevant data.
    *   Implement initial handlers for common UI events and user requests.
4.  **Basic Orchestration Logic:**
    *   Develop a basic mechanism for Nara to delegate tasks or request information. Initially, this will focus on:
        *   Querying the `bimba_map` (via existing or new tools like `querybimbagraph`, `bimbaknowing`) for insights into archetypal patterns and the underlying unity of symbols.
        *   Formulating requests to the `epii` agent for philosophical or deeper symbolic context, touching upon both Jungian depth and Saivist perspectives on consciousness.
    *   The architecture should be extensible to accommodate future specialized sub-agents.
5.  **Information Synthesis (Initial Jungian-Saivist Lens):**
    *   Implement a rudimentary synthesis capability to combine information from the `bimba_map` (e.g., archetypal connections, symbolic resonances reflecting expressions of Paramashiva) and `epii` agent responses (e.g., philosophical reflections on psychic processes and the nature of consciousness) into a coherent format for the UI. This synthesis should begin to frame information through a Jungian-Saivist lens, highlighting potential connections to individuation, archetypes, the unconscious, and the dynamic, creative unfolding of consciousness (Lila, Cit-Shakti).
6.  **Narrative Coherence (Jungian-Socratic-Saivist Voice Stub):**
    *   Establish a basic framework for maintaining Nara's unique voice in communications. This voice should be Socratic, reflective, and subtly informed by Jungian principles and Saivist wonder (acknowledging Svatantrya – ultimate freedom/autonomy of consciousness), aiming to guide the user's self-exploration towards recognizing their own divine nature rather than providing definitive answers. Even initial responses should hint at this supportive, depth-oriented, and liberating persona.
7.  **Logging and Diagnostics:** Implement logging for agent activities, errors, and key decision points to aid in development and debugging.

**Dependencies:**

*   Defined `ag-ui` protocol specification.
*   Access to `bimba_map` (Neo4j) and its query mechanisms.
*   Interface for communicating with the `epii` agent.
*   Session management infrastructure (e.g., database, caching).

**Notes:**

*   This story lays the groundwork for the Nara agent, embedding Jungian psychological principles at its core, subtly interwoven with foundational Kashmir Saivism concepts that enrich the understanding of consciousness and transformation. More advanced orchestration and synthesis, further developing this integrated orientation, will be covered in subsequent stories.
*   The focus is on establishing the core message handling loop, state management, and the initial pathways for data retrieval and command delegation.
*   "Future sub-agents" are out of scope for this specific story but the design should anticipate their integration.
