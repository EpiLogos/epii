# Epic 4: Nara Agent Core & Coordination - Story Index

This index summarizes the user stories within Epic 4, which focuses on establishing the Nara agent as the central orchestrating intelligence for the Epi-Logos system. This epic covers Nara's foundational capabilities, its role in contextualizing the `bimba_map` for the user's individuation journey, design for future inter-agent coordination, and the necessary infrastructure for communication and data integration.

## Feature F1: Nara Agent Development

*   **E4_F1_S1: Nara Agent Foundation: Core Orchestration for Individuation and Conscious Play**
    *   **Purpose:** Implement the foundational Nara Prime agent with core functionalities like user session management, state tracking (Jungian & Saivist context), UI input processing via `ag-ui` protocol, and basic orchestration for interaction with the `epii` agent and `bimba_map`. This aims to establish Nara as the central intelligence supporting user self-discovery and recognition of their creative potency (Cit-Shakti) and the Self (Atman), within a Jungian-informed and Saivist-aware framework.
*   **E4_F1_S2: Nara Prime: `bimba_map` Contextualization for Individuation & Symbolic Resonance Management**
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Nara to act as the primary vector for accessing and pragmatizing the `bimba_map`'s symbolic knowledge, tailoring insights to the user's individuation journey and managing their long-term symbolic metabolism (Spanda). This is to provide personalized, contextually relevant guidance that evolves with the user's development, fostering deeper self-awareness (Atman) and recognition of the creative play (Lila) of consciousness.
*   **E4_F1_S3: Nara: Design for Future Epi-Logos Agent Coordination, Enhancing Individuation & Cosmic Dialogue**
    *   **Purpose:** Design Nara's architecture to eventually coordinate with other specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara, Mahamaya, Parashakti, Paramasiva) as expert consultants. This will allow Nara to leverage a wider range of specialized knowledge to deepen the user's individuation journey and appreciation of the multifaceted play (Lila) of consciousness, maintaining the `bimba_map` as the foundational source of coherence.

## Feature F3: Inter-Agent Communication Infrastructure

*   **E4_F3_S1: BPMCP Service Enrichment: Assessing & Defining Pathways for Conscious Dialogue**
    *   **Purpose:** Assess the current BPMCP (Bimba-Pratibimba Memory-MCP) service capabilities and define necessary enrichments to ensure it can effectively act as the primary mechanism for structured communication and workflow orchestration between Nara, its data sources (Neo4j for `bimba_map`, Mongo for journey data, LightRAG), the `epii` agent, and future sub-agents. This is to create a robust backbone for data exchange supporting the user's individuation.
*   **E4_F3_S2: A2A Protocol for Dynamic Synthesis: Weaving the Fabric of Conscious Experience**
    *   **Purpose:** Develop or integrate A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols to enable more dynamic, potentially multimedia, and real-time synthesis of information between Nara and other specialized Epi-Logos agents. This aims to facilitate richer, immersive user experiences (akin to active imagination or meditative states) by combining diverse outputs like glyph animations, yantras, or soundscapes, supporting individuation and recognition of Svatantrya.

## Feature F4: External Service & Data Integration

*   **E4_F4_S1: Neo4j `bimba_map` Integration via BPMCP: Accessing the Wellspring of Symbolic Consciousness**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensure robust integration of Nara with the Neo4j Knowledge Graph (`bimba_map`) via the BPMCP service. This allows Nara to efficiently query symbolic associations, archetypal relationships, and mythological data to contextualize user experiences, illuminate their individuation path, and provide deep insights fostering recognition of their true nature (Svarupa).
*   **E4_F4_S2: Real-Time Astrological Service Integration: Harmonizing with Cosmic Rhythms & Archetypal Dynamics**
    *   **Purpose:** Integrate Nara with real-time astrological calculation services to access current planetary positions and aspects. This data, viewed as symbolic indicators of active archetypal forces (Jung) and cosmic energy (Spanda), will be incorporated into Oracle readings and guidance, helping users navigate their individuation journey with awareness of transpersonal patterns.
*   **E4_F4_S3: `ag-ui` Protocol Integration: Facilitating the Dialogue Between User and Inner Wisdom**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensure seamless and robust `ag-ui` (Agent-UI) protocol integration for communication between the frontend (user's conscious interaction) and the backend (Nara agent system). This allows UI context to inform Nara's processing and Nara's synthesized information to be accurately rendered in the UI, supporting the user's individuation and journey towards Svatantrya.

## Feature F5: Prompt Engineering & Synthesis Logic

*   **E4_F5_S1: Sophisticated Prompt Engineering & Synthesis Logic: Weaving Wisdom for Self-Realization**
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Nara to utilize sophisticated prompt engineering and synthesis logic to query data sources (like `bimba_map`), consult other agents (like `epii`), and intelligently combine outputs. This is to maintain Nara's unique voice, deliver relevant insights (Pratibha), and leverage the `bimba_map`'s epistemic unifications for coherent, multi-layered guidance that fosters self-recognition (Pratyabhijna).
