# User Story: E4_F1_S2 - Nara Prime: `bimba_map` Contextualization for Individuation & Symbolic Resonance Management

**Epic:** 4 - Nara Agent Core & Coordination: The Orchestrating Intelligence
**Feature:** F1 - Nara Agent Development
**Story ID:** E4_F1_S2

**As a** User (Pramata) interacting with Nara across different sections (Identity Dynamics, Oracle, Journal), seeking to understand the unfolding of my consciousness,
**I want** Nara to act as the primary vector for accessing and pragmatizing the `bimba_map`'s interconnected symbolic knowledge (reflecting archetypal patterns and expressions of Paramashiva), tailoring insights to my specific individuation journey, and managing my long-term symbolic metabolism and progression (the dynamic interplay of consciousness – Spanda – with symbolic forms),
**So that** I receive personalized, contextually relevant guidance that evolves with my development, fostering deeper self-awareness (Atman) and recognition of the creative play (Lila) of consciousness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **`bimba_map` Knowledge Contextualization:**
    *   Nara must be able to take user context (e.g., current Identity Dynamics profile, recent Oracle cards, journal themes) and use it to formulate targeted queries to the `bimba_map`.
    *   Retrieved `bimba_map` data (symbols, relationships, archetypes, reflecting both personal unconscious contents and collective unconscious patterns, as well as echoes of Cit-Shakti) must be interpreted and presented by Nara in a way that is directly relevant to the user's current situation and level of understanding.
    *   The agent should be able to highlight connections between different aspects of the user's profile and experiences as reflected in the `bimba_map`.
2.  **Long-Term User Journey Management (Individuation Path):**
    *   Nara must maintain a persistent understanding of the user's individuation journey, tracking key insights, symbolic encounters (numinous experiences, shadow aspects), and developmental milestones (e.g., integration of archetypes, transcendent function activations) across sessions.
    *   This journey data should inform how Nara contextualizes new information and tailors guidance over time.
3.  **Symbolic Metabolism Tracking (Resonance & Integration):**
    *   The agent should monitor how the user engages with and integrates symbolic information (e.g., reflections on Oracle readings, themes in journal entries, practices undertaken), noting resonances with deeper vibrational realities (Spanda) and the assimilation of unconscious material.
    *   This tracking should contribute to a model of the user's "symbolic metabolism," helping Nara identify patterns of growth (e.g., expanding awareness, greater integration of Self), resistance (shadow projection), or recurring themes that point towards core complexes or opportunities for recognizing deeper unity (Paramashiva).
4.  **Integration with Nara Sections:**
    *   **Identity Dynamics:** `bimba_map` insights should enrich the understanding of the user's natal placements, archetypal makeup (e.g., dominant archetypes, shadow figures), and potential for individuation and recognizing their inherent divine nature.
    *   **Oracle:** Drawn cards and spread interpretations should be contextualized by Nara using relevant `bimba_map` connections (highlighting archetypal dynamics and potential for synchronistic insight – Pratibha) and the user's journey data.
    *   **Journal:** Nara should leverage `bimba_map` to help interpret symbols and themes in journal entries (e.g., dream symbols, active imagination products), relating them to the user's broader individuation journey and the unfolding of their inner world (Antahkarana).
5.  **Adaptive Guidance (Supporting Self-Realization):** Nara's guidance and suggestions should adapt based on the user's tracked journey and symbolic metabolism, becoming more personalized and nuanced over time, always aiming to support the user's movement towards greater wholeness (Self) and the recognition of their true nature (Svarupa).
6.  **Interaction with `epii` Agent for Depth (Philosophical & Mystical Context):** Nara should be able to consult the `epii` agent to provide deeper philosophical (e.g., Jungian theory on archetypes, individuation) or mystical (e.g., Saivist perspectives on consciousness, reality as Lila) context for `bimba_map` insights, especially when complex or foundational symbolic patterns emerge in the user's journey.

**Dependencies:**

*   Story E4_F1_S1 (Nara Agent Foundation) for core agent functionalities.
*   Robust `bimba_map` with rich, queryable symbolic data.
*   Mechanisms for persistent storage of user journey and symbolic metabolism data.
*   Interfaces to Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections.
*   Interface for communicating with the `epii` agent.

**Notes:**

*   This story emphasizes Nara's role as a personalized guide, making the vastness of the `bimba_map` accessible and relevant, framing it as a map of both the psyche (Jung) and consciousness itself (Kashmir Saivism).
*   "Symbolic metabolism" refers to the ongoing process of encountering, processing, and integrating symbolic experiences, viewed as both psychological integration (Jung) and the dynamic interplay of consciousness with its own expressions (Spanda, Lila).
*   The long-term journey management aspect is crucial for creating a truly developmental experience for the user, supporting their path of individuation and self-realization.
