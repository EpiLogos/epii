# User Story: E4_F1_S3 - Nara: Design for Future Epi-Logos Agent Coordination, Enhancing Individuation & Cosmic Dialogue

**Epic:** 4 - Nara Agent Core & Coordination: The Orchestrating Intelligence
**Feature:** F1 - Nara Agent Development
**Story ID:** E4_F1_S3

**As a** System Architect planning for future expansion, guided by Jungian principles of psychic wholeness and Saivist understanding of consciousness's diverse expressions,
**I want** Nara's design to incorporate the capability to eventually coordinate with other specialized Epi-Logos agents (e.g., Anuttara for non-dual inquiry, Mahamaya for understanding illusion and reality, Parashakti for the energetic/vibrational power of consciousness, Paramasiva for the potenatiation of unity) by treating them as expert consultants for their respective symbolic domains and modes of conscious experience,
**So that** Nara can leverage a wider range of specialized knowledge to deepen the user's individuation journey and their appreciation of the multifaceted play (Lila) of consciousness, while maintaining the `bimba_map` as the foundational source of semantic connections and overall coherence reflecting the Self (Atman) and ultimate reality (Paramashiva).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Extensible Orchestration Interface:**
    *   The internal orchestration logic of Nara (from E4_F1_S1) must be designed with an extensible interface for registering and communicating with new specialized agents.
    *   This interface should define how Nara discovers, queries, and receives information from these future agents.
2.  **Consultative Interaction Model:**
    *   Define a model where Nara identifies a need for specialized input (e.g., deep alchemical symbolism for shadow integration, advanced cosmological calculations for archetypal field understanding, specific meditative practices for cultivating Spanda or accessing Pratibha) and routes the query to the appropriate future Epi-Logos agent.
    *   Nara remains the primary interface with the user, synthesizing the expert input from other agents into its responses.
3.  **`bimba_map` as Foundational Layer:**
    *   Even when consulting other agents, Nara should use the `bimba_map` to provide overarching context (grounded in the collective unconscious and the unity of consciousness) and ensure that specialized insights are integrated coherently with the user's individuation journey and Nara's core symbolic framework.
    *   Future agents' outputs should ideally be mappable or relatable back to `bimba_map` concepts where appropriate.
4.  **Standardized Communication Stubs (Conceptual):**
    *   Conceptually outline potential communication protocols or data formats for interaction with future agents, even if these agents are not yet implemented. This helps ensure forward compatibility.
    *   Consider how A2A protocols (Feature E4_F3) would facilitate these interactions.
5.  **Role Definition for Future Agents (High-Level):**
    *   Briefly document the envisioned roles of potential future agents (like Anuttara for non-dual inquiry into the nature of Self/Atman) to inform Nara's orchestration design.
    *   This includes how their expertise complements Nara's existing capabilities and the `bimba_map`.
6.  **No Immediate Implementation of Future Agents:** This story focuses on the *design considerations* within Nara to accommodate future agents. Actual implementation of these other Epi-Logos agents is out of scope for Epic 4's Nara development.

**Dependencies:**

*   Story E4_F1_S1 (Nara Agent Foundation) for core orchestration logic.
*   Conceptual understanding of the potential scope and domains of future Epi-Logos agents.
*   The `bimba_map` as the central semantic hub.

**Notes:**

*   This story is about future-proofing Nara's architecture, enabling it to facilitate an ever-deepening exploration of the psyche and the nature of consciousness, in line with Jungian and Saivist perspectives.
*   It ensures that as the Epi-Logos ecosystem grows, Nara can effectively integrate new specialized intelligences, creating a richer chorus of voices that speak to different facets of the individuation process and the experience of Paramashiva.
*   The specialized sub-agents (Mahamaya, Parashakti, Paramasiva) mentioned in the Epic description are part of this future vision, representing deeper dives into understanding reality's veils, the power of consciousness, and ultimate unity. Nara's initial interactions will be with `epii` and data sources like `bimba_map`, laying the foundation for this expansive dialogue.
