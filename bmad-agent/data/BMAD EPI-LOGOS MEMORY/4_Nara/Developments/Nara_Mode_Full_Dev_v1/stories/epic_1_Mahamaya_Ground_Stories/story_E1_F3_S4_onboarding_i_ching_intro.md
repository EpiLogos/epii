# Story E1.F3.S4: User Onboarding - Introduction to I Ching

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** User Onboarding Design & Implementation
**Sub-Feature:** Introducing the I Ching Concept in Onboarding
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on the part of the user onboarding flow that introduces the concept of the I Ching (Book of Changes). Similar to Gene Keys and Human Design, the primary I Ching hexagram(s) for the user might be derived from their birth data or linked to their Gene Keys/Human Design gates (as per Story 1.6). Therefore, this onboarding step is primarily informational.

The goal is to create an engaging UI screen within the onboarding flow that briefly explains what the I Ching is within the Nara context, informs the user that their relevant hexagram(s) will be (or have been) identified, and sets the expectation that this layer will be available for deeper exploration in the "Identity Dynamics" section.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Frontend - UI/UX Design):** A clear and visually appealing UI/UX for introducing the I Ching is designed as part of the onboarding flow, consistent with `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **AC2 (Frontend - Explanatory Content):** Engaging and easy-to-understand content is created that briefly explains the essence of the I Ching (e.g., ancient wisdom of change, patterns of energy, 64 hexagrams).
*   **AC3 (Frontend - Connection to Other Layers):** The UI communicates how the user's I Ching insights might be derived (e.g., from birth data, or in conjunction with their Gene Keys/Human Design).
*   **AC4 (Frontend - Confirmation/Acknowledgement):** The user acknowledges this introduction, understanding that their I Ching component is being integrated into their Mahamaya Ground.
*   **AC5 (Backend - Trigger/Flag for Hexagram Identification):** If the primary I Ching hexagram identification (Story 1.6 backend logic) is not automatically triggered by previous data, this onboarding step ensures the necessary flags are set or processes are initiated.
*   **AC6 (Frontend - Next Steps Indication):** The UI smoothly transitions the user to the next part of the onboarding or indicates that their I Ching insights will be explorable later in the main application.
*   **AC7 (Responsiveness & Accessibility):** The introductory screen is responsive and adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Content Creation):** Write concise, engaging, and accurate introductory text for the I Ching, tailored for a first-time user.
*   **Task 3.2 (UX Design):** Design the user flow for this introductory step within onboarding. Create wireframes/mockups. Refer to `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **Task 3.3 (UI Design):** Develop the visual design for this screen, potentially incorporating symbolic imagery related to the I Ching (e.g., hexagrams, trigrams, yin-yang symbol).
*   **Task 3.4 (Frontend - Development):** Implement the UI components for the I Ching introductory screen(s).
*   **Task 3.5 (Frontend - State Management):** Integrate this step into the overall onboarding state management.
*   **Task 3.6 (Backend - Coordination - Optional):** If hexagram identification isn't automatic, ensure this step triggers backend processes for I Ching data generation (Story 1.6) via API calls.
*   **Task 3.7 (Testing):** Test the display of introductory content. Conduct usability testing to ensure clarity and user understanding. Test UI components for responsiveness and accessibility.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Clarity and Brevity:** The I Ching is profound and complex. The introduction must be very high-level and inviting, not scholarly or dense.
*   **Visuals:** Appropriate visuals can help convey the essence of the I Ching without needing many words.
*   **Derivation Method:** Be clear (or appropriately vague if the exact method is complex) about how the user's hexagram(s) are determined to maintain transparency.
*   **User Journey:** This step continues to build the user's Mahamaya Ground. Ensure it feels like a natural progression.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Story E1.F3.S1 (Birth data collection), and potentially E1.F3.S3 if I Ching is linked to Gene Keys/HD.
*   Backend capabilities for I Ching hexagram identification (Story 1.6) must exist.
*   `ui-ux-spec.md` for design consistency.
*   Content strategy for explaining the I Ching simply.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Clarity:** The purpose and nature of the I Ching within Nara should be made clear at a high level.
*   **Engagement:** The presentation should make the user curious to explore their I Ching insights later.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** Users will not be required to input any new data for I Ching at this stage; it's primarily informational.
*   **Question:** How will the onboarding address the oracular nature of the I Ching versus the 'natal' hexagram aspect? For onboarding, the focus is likely on the natal/archetypal hexagram(s).
*   **Question:** Will the specific method of deriving the hexagram (e.g., from Gene Key, Human Design Gate, or other astrological points) be mentioned, or just a general statement that it's part of their unique blueprint?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.

**Next Steps:** Review against `story-draft-checklist.md`. The final step in the Mahamaya Ground onboarding will be the reveal and explanation of the synthesized Archetypal Quintessence.
