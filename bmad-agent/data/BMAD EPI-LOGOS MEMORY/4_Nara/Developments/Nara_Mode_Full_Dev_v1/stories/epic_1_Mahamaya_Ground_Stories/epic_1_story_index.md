# Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation - Story Index

**Epic Goal:** To implement the "Mahamaya Ground," the foundational 64-fold archetypal layer of the Nara application. This involves establishing the core backend data structures (Mahamaya Matrix and Bimba Map), defining their interaction, designing a comprehensive user onboarding flow to gather initial psychometric and esoteric data, synthesizing this into an "Archetypal Quintessence," and developing the initial frontend expressions and personalization engine based on this unique user identity.

## User Stories (Successfully Read):

1.  **`story_E1_F1_S1_mahamaya_matrix_backend_foundation.md`**: Defines the backend foundation for the Mahamaya Matrix, including MongoDB schema for user data (natal info, Jungian type, Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching, Quintessence) and API endpoints for data management. This matrix stores the user's unique 64-fold archetypal data.
2.  **`story_E1_F2_S1_bimba_map_foundation.md`**: Establishes the Bimba Map, a Neo4j graph database representing universal symbolic relationships and archetypal knowledge, and its initial seeding with core concepts relevant to Nara's systems (Astrology, I Ching, Gene Keys, etc.).
3.  **`story_E1_F2_S2_matrix_bimba_interaction_layer.md`**: Details the development of an interaction layer or service that allows the Mahamaya Matrix (individual user data) to query and relate to the Bimba Map (universal symbolic data), enabling personalized insights.
4.  **`story_E1_F3_S1_onboarding_flow_design.md`**: Focuses on designing the user onboarding experience for the Mahamaya Ground, guiding users through initial data input (birth details, assessments) and introducing the core concepts that will form their Archetypal Quintessence.
5.  **`story_E1_F3_S2_jungian_assessment_integration.md`**: Covers the integration of a Jungian psychological type assessment (e.g., MBTI-like or a custom tool) into the onboarding flow to determine the user's cognitive functions and elemental balance.
6.  **`story_E1_F3_S3_gene_keys_human_design_intro.md`**: Details the introduction of Gene Keys and Human Design concepts during the onboarding process, explaining their relevance and preparing for data input or calculation related to these systems.
7.  **`story_E1_F3_S4_i_ching_introduction.md`**: Describes how the I Ching and its 64 hexagrams are introduced to the user during onboarding, setting the stage for its integration into their archetypal profile.
8.  **`story_E1_F3_S5_quintessence_reveal_onboarding.md`**: Focuses on the UI/UX for revealing the user's synthesized Archetypal Quintessence at a key moment during the onboarding process, presenting it as a significant milestone.
9.  **`story_E1_F4_S1_identity_dynamics_dashboard.md`**: Details the design and implementation of the "Identity Dynamics" dashboard, the primary UI where users can explore their Mahamaya Ground data, Archetypal Quintessence, and related insights.
10. **`story_E1_F4_S2_personalized_visual_motifs.md`**: Covers the integration of subtle, personalized visual motifs (colors, patterns) throughout the Nara UI, derived from the user's Mahamaya Matrix data to create an immersive, resonant experience.
11. **`story_E1_F4_S3_quintessence_visualization.md`**: Addresses the design and implementation of a dynamic, interactive visualization for the user's Archetypal Quintessence (e.g., as a sigil, mandala, or custom tarot card) within the Identity Dynamics section, allowing exploration of its constituent layers.
12. **`story_E1_F5_S2_recursive_personalization_engine.md`**: Details the development of a backend "Recursive Personalization Engine" that uses the user's Mahamaya Matrix/Quintessence to tailor Nara's outputs (Oracle readings, journal prompts, practices) for deeply individualized guidance.
13. **`story_E1_S1_birthdate_encoding.md`**: Covers the UI for birthdate/time input and the backend logic to encode this into a unique "Seed Formula," the foundational numerical/archetypal signature for the user's Mahamaya Ground.
