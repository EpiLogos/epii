# Story E1.F4.S1: Frontend - Identity Dynamics Dashboard Design & Implementation

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Frontend Expression & Visualization
**Sub-Feature:** Design and Implementation of the "Identity Dynamics" Dashboard/Mandala
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on designing and implementing the primary user interface for the "Identity Dynamics" section, as described in `epic-1.md` and `ui-ux-spec.md`. This section will serve as a living dashboard or "mandala" where users can view, explore, and interact with all layers of their Mahamaya Ground (Birthdate Encoding, Natal Chart, Jungian Type, Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching, and Archetypal Quintessence) after the initial onboarding.

The goal is to create an intuitive, engaging, and visually rich interface that allows users to easily navigate and understand the different facets of their synthesized identity. It should provide an overview and allow for deeper dives into each specific symbolic system.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Frontend - UI/UX Design):** A comprehensive UI/UX design for the "Identity Dynamics" dashboard is created, adhering to `ui-ux-spec.md`. This includes layout, navigation, and visual representation of the Mahamaya Ground components.
*   **AC2 (Frontend - Dashboard Overview):** The dashboard provides a clear, high-level overview of the user's complete Mahamaya Ground, perhaps visually represented as a mandala or an interactive constellation of their identity layers.
*   **AC3 (Frontend - Navigation to Layers):** Users can easily navigate from the dashboard overview to detailed views of each of the six core layers and the Archetypal Quintessence.
*   **AC4 (Frontend - Data Display):** Key information from each layer (e.g., Sun Sign, Jungian Type, Life's Work Gene Key, HD Type, Primary I Ching Hexagram, Quintessence Title/Image) is summarized and displayed on the dashboard overview.
*   **AC5 (Backend - Data Retrieval):** The frontend successfully retrieves all necessary data for the Mahamaya Ground layers from the backend (Mahamaya Matrix in MongoDB).
*   **AC6 (Frontend - Interactive Elements):** The dashboard includes interactive elements that encourage exploration and provide further insights upon interaction (e.g., hover-overs, clickable components leading to more detail).
*   **AC7 (Frontend - Dynamic Updates):** The dashboard is designed to potentially reflect updates or new insights as the user interacts more with Nara (though initial implementation may be static post-onboarding).
*   **AC8 (Responsiveness & Accessibility):** The dashboard is fully responsive across devices and adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (UX Design):** Define the overall user experience for the Identity Dynamics dashboard. Create wireframes and user flows for navigating the dashboard and accessing individual layer details. Refer to `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **Task 3.2 (UI Design):** Develop the visual design for the dashboard, including the central "mandala" or overview concept, color schemes, typography, and iconography. Ensure it aligns with Nara's aesthetic and the significance of the Mahamaya Ground.
*   **Task 3.3 (Frontend - Component Development):** Develop reusable UI components for displaying summaries of each Mahamaya Ground layer on the dashboard.
*   **Task 3.4 (Frontend - Dashboard Layout):** Implement the main layout and structure of the Identity Dynamics dashboard.
*   **Task 3.5 (Frontend - API Integration):** Integrate with backend APIs to fetch and display all relevant user data for the Mahamaya Ground layers.
*   **Task 3.6 (Frontend - Navigation Logic):** Implement navigation from the dashboard overview to the detailed views of each specific layer.
*   **Task 3.7 (Frontend - Interactivity):** Add interactive elements (e.g., tooltips, expandable sections) to enhance user engagement and information discovery.
*   **Task 3.8 (Testing):** Conduct thorough testing of data display, navigation, interactivity, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Information Architecture:** Carefully consider how to present a large amount of complex information in an accessible and non-overwhelming way.
*   **Visual Metaphor:** The "mandala" or "living dashboard" concept should be thoughtfully executed to be both aesthetically pleasing and functionally informative.
*   **Performance:** Ensure the dashboard loads efficiently, even with multiple data points being fetched and displayed.
*   **Modularity:** Design components in a modular way to facilitate future updates or additions to the Mahamaya Ground.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain visual and interactive consistency with the onboarding experience and the rest of the Nara application, as guided by `ui-ux-spec.md`.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of all Mahamaya Ground data generation and storage stories (Epic 1, Features 1 & 2).
*   Completion of User Onboarding stories (Epic 1, Feature 3) so users have data to display.
*   Availability of backend APIs to retrieve all Mahamaya Matrix data.
*   `ui-ux-spec.md` for detailed UI/UX guidelines.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Engaging & Intuitive:** The dashboard should be enjoyable to interact with and easy to understand.
*   **Aesthetically Pleasing:** The visual design should be of high quality and reflect the depth of the content.
*   **Scalability:** The design should accommodate potential future additions to the user's identity profile.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** All necessary data points for each layer of the Mahamaya Ground are defined and accessible via backend APIs.
*   **Question:** What is the primary visual metaphor for the dashboard overview (mandala, constellation, interactive diagram, etc.)? This needs to be finalized based on `ui-ux-spec.md` and further design exploration.
*   **Question:** How much detail for each layer is shown on the main dashboard versus requiring a click-through to a dedicated page/section for that layer?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.

**Next Steps:** Review against `story-draft-checklist.md`. This story covers the main dashboard. Subsequent stories for this feature will detail the visualization of individual layers and the Quintessence.
