# Story 1.4: Gene Keys - The 64 Archetypal Codes of the Psyche

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Implement the Six Nested Layers of #0 (Mahamaya Ground)
**Sub-Feature:** Gene Keys (The 64 Archetypal Codes)
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on generating and integrating the user's Gene Keys profile. These 64 "keys" represent profound archetypal energies, akin to Jung's concept of archetypes residing in the collective unconscious, and are derived from the user's birth data. They offer insights into the user's innate psychic structure, potential for growth, shadow aspects, and their unique path of individuation. The Gene Keys serve as deep mythic resonances, informing oracle readings and themes of personal transformation within the Mahamaya Ground, guiding the user towards a more integrated sense of Self.

The goal is to implement backend logic for Gene Keys profile generation (linked to astrological data from Story 1.2) and UI elements to display this profile, framing it as a map for self-discovery and psycho-spiritual development.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Archetypal Profile Generation):** Based on the user's birth data (astrological calculations from Story 1.2), the system generates the Gene Keys profile. This profile illuminates core archetypal patterns and dynamics relevant to the user's individuation journey, including key Gene Keys (e.g., Life's Work, Evolution, Radiance, Purpose) and their lines, which signify different expressions of these archetypes.
*   **AC2 (Backend - Archetypal Data Storage):** The Gene Keys profile data, representing a significant layer of the user's archetypal blueprint, is stored in MongoDB within their Mahamaya Ground data.
*   **AC3 (UI - Display Archetypal Profile):** Within 
*   **AC4 (UI - Integration with Mahamaya Ground):** The display of the Gene Keys profile is visually and functionally integrated into the Mahamaya Ground interface, consistent with `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **AC5 (UI - Archetypal Explanations & Reflections):** The UI provides brief descriptions for Gene Keys and lines, framing them in terms of archetypal energies, potential life lessons, shadow aspects to be integrated, and gifts to be cultivated. The language will be invitational and reflective, encouraging self-exploration rather than deterministic interpretation, subtly hinting at the connection between psychological integration and deeper spiritual insights (e.g., Kashmir Saivism's non-dual perspective).
*   **AC6 (UI - Navigating the Individuation Path):** The user can navigate their primary Gene Keys, understanding them as waypoints on their individuation journey. Future enhancements could allow deeper exploration of all 64 archetypal themes.
*   **AC7 (Responsiveness):** The Gene Keys profile display is responsive and functions correctly across defined breakpoints as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **AC8 (Accessibility):** The Gene Keys profile display adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Research/Content):** Determine the exact methodology for deriving Gene Keys from birth data/astrological positions. Identify the specific Gene Keys to be highlighted in the profile (e.g., the Golden Path sequence).
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend):** Implement the backend logic to calculate/derive the user's Gene Keys profile based on their natal chart data (from Story 1.2).
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend):** Design the schema and implement storage for the Gene Keys profile data in MongoDB.
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend):** Develop an API endpoint to retrieve the Gene Keys profile for a user.
*   **Task 3.5 (Frontend):** Design and develop the UI components to display the key Gene Keys and their lines within the Mahamaya Ground.
*   **Task 3.6 (Frontend):** Implement UI elements for displaying brief descriptions or keywords for the Gene Keys.
*   **Task 3.7 (Frontend):** Integrate the frontend components with the backend API to fetch and display the user-specific Gene Keys profile.
*   **Task 3.8 (Testing):** Write unit tests for backend Gene Keys derivation logic. Perform cross-validation of profile generation if possible. Test UI components for accuracy, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Gene Keys Calculation & Archetypal Resonance:** The derivation of Gene Keys (linked to I Ching/zodiac) needs accurate implementation. The focus is on how these calculations reveal underlying archetypal patterns and their relevance to the user's psyche. *Developer Note: Liaise with project lead for precise logic, ensuring it supports a Jungian and psycho-spiritual interpretation.*
*   **Data Source for Archetypal Interpretations:** Core Gene Keys descriptions will be stored locally, crafted to align with Jungian psychology and the broader psycho-spiritual framework of Nara, including subtle nods to philosophies like Kashmir Saivism where appropriate.
*   **Scope of Display:** Decide on the initial scope of the Gene Keys profile to display (e.g., just the primary keys of the Golden Path, or more). Full display of all 64 keys and their lines could be complex for an initial version.
*   **UI/UX & Symbolic Journey:** The presentation should clearly convey the significance of Gene Keys as symbolic guides on the user's journey of self-discovery and integration. The UI should evoke a sense of exploring a personal myth or archetypal landscape. Refer to `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **BPMCP Integration & Collective Unconscious:** Gene Keys data, representing specific archetypal expressions, will be part of the `bimba_map`, linking individual experience to broader patterns of the collective unconscious and symbolic systems.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Story 1.2 (Astrological Natal Chart) as Gene Keys are typically derived from astrological data.
*   Defined methodology for Gene Keys calculation/derivation from birth data.
*   Content (descriptions/keywords) for the key Gene Keys to be displayed.
*   Access to `ui-ux-spec.md` for design guidelines.
*   Access to `epic-1.md` for feature context.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Accuracy:** Gene Keys profile generation must be accurate based on the defined methodology.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The specific algorithm/logic for deriving Gene Keys from natal chart data will be provided or co-developed.
*   **Question:** What is the definitive list of "key" Gene Keys to be displayed in the initial profile (e.g., Golden Path sequence: Life's Work, Evolution, Radiance, Purpose, etc.)?
*   **Question:** Will the system need to store descriptions for all 64 Gene Keys and their lines, or only for the primary ones displayed?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
