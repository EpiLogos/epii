# Story E1.F2.S1: Backend System for Mahamaya Matrix

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Backend System Development & Bimba Map Foundation
**Sub-Feature:** Mahamaya Matrix Storage and Management
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on developing the robust backend systems required to store, process, and manage the multi-layered user context object, referred to as the "Mahamaya Matrix." This matrix encapsulates all the data gathered from the six layers of the Mahamaya Ground (Birthdate Encoding, Natal Chart, Jungian Type, Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching) and the synthesized Archetypal Quintessence.

The goal is to design and implement the MongoDB schema for the Users collection to effectively store this complex, nested data, and to create the necessary API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving a user's Mahamaya Matrix.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Schema Design):** A comprehensive and efficient MongoDB schema is designed for the `Users` collection to store the Mahamaya Matrix. This schema must accommodate all data points from Stories 1.1 through 1.7 (Birthdate Encoding, Natal Chart, Jungian Type, Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching, and Archetypal Quintessence).
*   **AC2 (Backend - Data Integrity):** The system ensures data integrity for the Mahamaya Matrix, including appropriate data types, validation, and handling of potentially missing or incomplete data from any layer.
*   **AC3 (Backend - API Endpoints - CRUD):** Secure and efficient API endpoints are developed to:
    *   Create/initialize a user's Mahamaya Matrix (typically during onboarding).
    *   Update specific layers or components of a user's Mahamaya Matrix (e.g., if they retake an assessment or new data is derived).
    *   Retrieve a user's complete Mahamaya Matrix.
    *   Retrieve specific parts/layers of a user's Mahamaya Matrix.
*   **AC4 (Backend - Security):** Sensitive data within the Mahamaya Matrix (especially birthdate information) is handled securely, including encryption at rest and appropriate access controls for the APIs.
*   **AC5 (Backend - Performance):** API endpoints for retrieving Mahamaya Matrix data are performant and can handle concurrent requests efficiently.
*   **AC6 (Documentation):** The MongoDB schema and API endpoints are well-documented.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Backend - Design):** Design the detailed MongoDB schema for the `Users` collection, specifically for the Mahamaya Matrix. Consider nesting, references, and indexing strategies.
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend - Implementation):** Implement the Mongoose models (or equivalent for your chosen Node.js framework) based on the designed schema.
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend - API Development):** Develop the CRUD API endpoints for managing the Mahamaya Matrix. This includes:
    *   `POST /users/:userId/mahamaya-matrix` (or part of user creation)
    *   `PUT /users/:userId/mahamaya-matrix/:layer`
    *   `GET /users/:userId/mahamaya-matrix`
    *   `GET /users/:userId/mahamaya-matrix/:layer`
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend - Security):** Implement security measures, including input validation, authentication/authorization for API endpoints, and encryption for sensitive fields (e.g., birthdate components if stored directly, though derivation is preferred).
*   **Task 3.5 (Backend - Testing):** Write unit and integration tests for the schema, models, and API endpoints. Test for data integrity, security vulnerabilities, and performance.
*   **Task 3.6 (Documentation):** Document the schema structure and API endpoint specifications (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Database Choice:** MongoDB is specified in `epic-1.md`.
*   **Schema Flexibility vs. Strictness:** While MongoDB is schema-flexible, a well-defined schema at the application layer (e.g., via Mongoose) is crucial for consistency and maintainability.
*   **Data Relationships:** Consider how different layers of the matrix relate. For instance, the Archetypal Quintessence is derived from the other six.
*   **Scalability:** Design the schema and queries with scalability in mind as the number of users and the complexity of data grow.
*   **Encryption:** As per `epic-1.md`, "Each user data object contains encrypted birthdate matrices." Ensure this is implemented correctly for any raw birth data used in derivations.
*   **Versioning:** Consider if/how the Mahamaya Matrix schema might evolve and if versioning is needed for user data.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Stories 1.1 through 1.7, as they define the data content of the Mahamaya Matrix.
*   A clear understanding of the data structures produced by each of the Mahamaya Ground layers.
*   Overall backend architecture and authentication/authorization mechanisms for the Nara application.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Reliability:** The backend system must reliably store and retrieve user data.
*   **Maintainability:** The code and schema should be well-organized and maintainable.
*   **Security:** User data, especially PII like birthdates, must be protected.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The overall backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express/NestJS) and authentication system are already defined or will be concurrently developed.
*   **Question:** What are the specific PII components of the birthdate that need encryption versus the derived (less sensitive) numerical encodings?
*   **Question:** What level of granularity is needed for updating parts of the matrix? (e.g., update a single Gene Key vs. the whole Gene Keys profile).

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
