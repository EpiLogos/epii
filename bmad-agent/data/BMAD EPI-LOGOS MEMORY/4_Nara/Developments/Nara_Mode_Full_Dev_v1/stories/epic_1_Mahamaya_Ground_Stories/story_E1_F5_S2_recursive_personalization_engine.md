# Story E1.F5.S2: Backend - Recursive Personalization Engine for Nara Outputs

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** 64-Fold Resonance & Recursive Personalization
**Sub-Feature:** Development of a Personalization Engine for Oracle, Journal, and Practices
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story addresses the requirement from `epic-1.md` that "All Nara outputs (tarot draws, journal prompts, practices) must be filtered through the quintessentialised archetypal user identity for deeply individualized and archetypally coherent guidance." This involves creating a backend engine or system that leverages the user's full Mahamaya Matrix, particularly their Archetypal Quintessence, to personalize content generated by other Nara modules (e.g., Oracle, Journal, future Practice modules).

The goal is to develop a robust "Recursive Personalization Engine" that can take a generic piece of content (like a tarot card meaning, a journal prompt theme, or a practice suggestion) and tailor its interpretation, emphasis, or related suggestions based on the user's unique archetypal profile. This ensures that guidance feels deeply relevant and resonant.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Engine Design):** A clear design for the Personalization Engine is created, outlining its inputs (user's Mahamaya Matrix/Quintessence, generic content/context), processing logic, and outputs (personalized content/guidance).
*   **AC2 (Backend - Mahamaya Matrix Integration):** The engine can effectively access and utilize relevant data from the user's Mahamaya Matrix, especially the Archetypal Quintessence and its constituent layers.
*   **AC3 (Backend - Content Input Interface):** An interface is defined for how other modules (Oracle, Journal) will pass content and context to the Personalization Engine.
*   **AC4 (Backend - Personalization Logic - Initial):** Initial personalization logic is implemented. This might involve: 
    *   Weighting interpretations based on user's elemental balance (from Jungian type).
    *   Highlighting aspects of a tarot card that resonate with the user's active Gene Keys or Human Design themes.
    *   Suggesting journal prompts that align with the user's current astrological transits or Quintessence themes.
*   **AC5 (Backend - `bimba_map` Utilization):** The engine leverages the `bimba_map` to understand universal symbolic connections, which can then be contextualized by the user's profile (e.g., if a tarot card relates to a concept also strong in the user's Gene Keys via `bimba_map`, that connection is emphasized).
*   **AC6 (Backend - Output Formatting):** The engine outputs personalized content in a structured format that can be easily consumed and displayed by the frontend/calling module.
*   **AC7 (Testing - Scenario-Based):** The engine is tested with various user profiles and content scenarios to ensure personalization is meaningful and coherent.
*   **AC8 (Documentation - Engine API & Logic):** The engine's API and core personalization logic are documented for use by other developers/modules.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (System Design - Personalization Strategies):** Research and define specific strategies for personalization. How does an "Air" type experience a "Water" tarot card differently? How does a specific Gene Key influence the interpretation of a journal theme?
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend - Engine Architecture):** Design the overall architecture of the Personalization Engine, including its modules, data flow, and interfaces.
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend - Mahamaya Matrix Access Layer):** Develop a component within the engine to efficiently query and extract relevant archetypal information from a user's Mahamaya Matrix.
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend - `bimba_map` Query Layer):** Develop a component to query the `bimba_map` for universal symbolic relationships relevant to the input content.
*   **Task 3.5 (Backend - Core Personalization Algorithm Development):** Implement the initial set of personalization rules and algorithms.
*   **Task 3.6 (Backend - API for Content Modules):** Define and implement the API endpoints or service calls that modules like Oracle and Journal will use to get personalized content.
*   **Task 3.7 (Prototyping - Oracle Integration):** Implement a prototype integration with the Oracle module, personalizing a few sample tarot card interpretations.
*   **Task 3.8 (Prototyping - Journal Integration):** Implement a prototype integration with the Journal module, personalizing a few sample journal prompts or themes.
*   **Task 3.9 (Testing & Refinement):** Test the engine extensively with diverse scenarios and refine the personalization logic based on outcomes.
*   **Task 3.10 (Documentation):** Document the engine's functionality, API, and how to extend its personalization rules.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Rule-Based vs. ML:** Initial implementation will likely be rule-based. Future iterations could explore machine learning for more nuanced personalization, but this is out of scope for the initial build.
*   **Modularity:** Design the engine so that new personalization rules or strategies for different types of content can be easily added.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The engine should ideally understand the context of the request (e.g., "user is asking about relationships" vs. "user is reflecting on career") to further refine personalization.
*   **Transparency (Optional):** Consider if/how to subtly indicate to the user *why* certain guidance is being emphasized for them (e.g., "Given your strong Fire element, you might resonate with this aspect...").
*   **Performance:** Personalization should not introduce significant delays in content delivery.
*   **`bimba_map` as Knowledge Source:** The `bimba_map` provides the "universal truths" or connections, while the Mahamaya Matrix provides the "personal lens" through which these truths are filtered.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completed Mahamaya Matrix definition and population (Features 1 & 2).
*   Completed Archetypal Quintessence synthesis (Story 1.7).
*   Established `bimba_map` structure and initial seeding (Story E1.F2.S2).
*   Basic functionality of other content-generating modules like Oracle and Journal (to be developed in other Epics, but their interface needs can be anticipated).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Coherence:** Personalized outputs should feel logically connected to the user's known archetypal profile.
*   **Insightfulness:** The personalization should ideally lead to deeper or more relevant insights for the user.
*   **Scalability:** The engine should be able to handle increasing numbers of users and personalization rules.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The Archetypal Quintessence provides a sufficiently rich summary of the user's profile to drive meaningful personalization.
*   **Question:** What is the initial set of personalization rules/heuristics that will be implemented for MVP?
*   **Question:** How will the "strength" or "relevance" of different aspects of the user's profile be weighted in the personalization logic?
*   **Question:** What is the exact interface contract between this engine and modules like the Oracle or Journal?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
