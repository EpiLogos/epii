# Story E1.F5.S1: Backend/Frontend - 64-Fold Resonance Architectural Foundation

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** 64-Fold Resonance & Recursive Personalization
**Sub-Feature:** Architectural Design for 64-Fold Systemic Harmony
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story addresses the requirement from `epic-1.md` to "Ensure each layer is structured around the 64-fold logic (I Ching, codons, Gene Keys, HD gates), harmonizing Mahamayaâ€™s mathematical ground with living symbolic systems." It also notes that "initial development must focus on 'creating the space'" because each layer's representation will be bespoke.

The goal is to define and implement the necessary architectural foundations, both backend and frontend, to support and harmonize systems based on the 64-fold pattern. This involves ensuring data models, APIs, and UI structures can accommodate and cross-reference these systems (like I Ching, Gene Keys, Human Design Gates) effectively, even if the detailed content for each is developed progressively. It's about establishing the common framework for these resonant systems.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Data Modeling):** Backend data models (e.g., in MongoDB for Mahamaya Matrix, and potentially in Neo4j for `bimba_map` cross-references) are designed or augmented to explicitly support the 64-unit structure for relevant symbolic systems (I Ching, Gene Keys, HD Gates).
*   **AC2 (Backend - API Design):** APIs are designed or updated to allow querying and retrieval of user-specific data related to these 64-fold systems (e.g., user's active Gene Keys, relevant I Ching hexagrams based on context).
*   **AC3 (Frontend - Data Structures):** Frontend data structures are defined to handle and manage data from these 64-fold systems efficiently.
*   **AC4 (Frontend - UI Component Philosophy):** A design philosophy or set of guidelines is established for how 64-fold systems will be represented in the UI, allowing for bespoke presentations while maintaining underlying structural consistency (e.g., a common way to list/display 64 items, even if their specific visuals differ).
*   **AC5 (System - Cross-Referencing Capability):** The architecture supports the potential for cross-referencing between different 64-fold systems (e.g., identifying which Gene Key corresponds to a specific HD Gate or I Ching Hexagram, as facilitated by the `bimba_map`).
*   **AC6 (Documentation - Architectural Guidelines):** Documentation is created outlining how new or existing 64-fold systems should be integrated into this architectural framework.
*   **AC7 (Scalability - "Creating the Space"):** The architecture is flexible enough to accommodate the addition or evolution of 64-fold symbolic systems without requiring major overhauls.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Analysis - System Requirements):** Analyze the specific requirements of I Ching, Gene Keys, and Human Design Gates in terms of their 64-fold structure and how they need to be stored, accessed, and displayed.
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend - Data Model Refinement):** Refine or design data models in MongoDB (Mahamaya Matrix) to store user-specific activations/data for each of the 64 units within these systems.
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend - `bimba_map` Integration Points):** Define how the `bimba_map` (Neo4j) will store the canonical relationships and correspondences *between* different 64-fold systems to enable cross-referencing.
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend - API Development/Update):** Develop or update API endpoints to serve data related to these 64-fold systems, including potential queries for cross-system resonances.
*   **Task 3.5 (Frontend - Core Data Handling):** Implement frontend services or state management logic to handle data from 64-fold systems.
*   **Task 3.6 (Frontend - UI Guideline Development):** In collaboration with UI/UX designers, develop guidelines or template components for presenting 64-fold data consistently yet flexibly (e.g., a base component for a list of 64 items that can be styled differently per system).
*   **Task 3.7 (Prototyping - Cross-Reference Example):** Implement a small prototype demonstrating a cross-reference between two 64-fold systems (e.g., showing the Gene Key related to a selected I Ching hexagram).
*   **Task 3.8 (Documentation):** Document the architectural decisions, data models, and API endpoints related to the 64-fold resonance.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Common Identifiers:** Consider using common identifiers or a mapping system for the 64 units across different systems where applicable (e.g., a numerical index from 1-64).
*   **`bimba_map` Role:** The `bimba_map` is crucial for storing the universal, pre-integrated knowledge of how these systems relate. The Mahamaya Matrix stores the user's specific expressions within them.
*   **Flexibility for Bespoke Layers:** While aiming for harmony, the architecture must allow each symbolic system (Gene Keys, HD, I Ching) to have its unique presentation and depth, as stated in `epic-1.md`.
*   **Performance of Cross-Referencing:** Queries involving cross-referencing multiple systems should be optimized.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure consistency in how the 64 units are referenced and stored.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Initial backend setup for Mahamaya Matrix (MongoDB) and `bimba_map` (Neo4j) (Feature 2 stories).
*   Basic implementation of individual 64-fold layers (Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching - Feature 1 stories) to provide concrete systems to architect for.
*   `ui-ux-spec.md` for visual consistency guidelines.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Maintainability:** The architecture should be easy to understand and maintain as the application evolves.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily accommodate new symbolic systems that might also use a 64-fold (or similar N-fold) structure.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure correct mapping and cross-referencing between systems.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The core 64-fold systems (I Ching, Gene Keys, HD Gates) are the primary focus for this architectural work initially.
*   **Question:** What level of detail is required for the cross-referencing in the MVP? (e.g., simple one-to-one mapping, or more complex relational data).
*   **Question:** How will the "mathematical ground" of Mahamaya (mentioned in `epic-1.md`) explicitly connect to or inform these symbolic 64-fold systems beyond the initial birthdate encoding?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
