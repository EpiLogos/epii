# Story E1.F2.S3: Mahamaya Matrix & Bimba Map Interaction Layer

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Backend System Development & Bimba Map Foundation
**Sub-Feature:** Interaction Logic between User's Mahamaya Matrix and Universal Bimba Map
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on developing the backend logic and service layer that enables the user's specific Mahamaya Matrix (stored in MongoDB) to interact with the universal symbolic knowledge stored in the `bimba_map` (Neo4j graph database). The goal is to create a system where interpretations, suggestions, or practices generated by Nara's agent subsystems are deeply personalized by filtering or contextualizing `bimba_map` data through the lens of the user's unique archetypal identity (Mahamaya Matrix).

This involves creating services that can take elements from a user's Mahamaya Matrix (e.g., their primary Gene Key, astrological Sun sign, dominant Jungian element), query the `bimba_map` for related universal symbols and interpretations, and then synthesize personalized insights.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Service Layer Design):** A well-defined service layer (or set of services) is designed within the backend to mediate interactions between the Mahamaya Matrix data (MongoDB) and the `bimba_map` (Neo4j).
*   **AC2 (Backend - Query Orchestration):** The service layer can receive user-specific archetypal data (e.g., a specific Gene Key ID, a planet in a sign) from the Mahamaya Matrix.
*   **AC3 (Backend - Contextualized Bimba Map Queries):** The service layer can dynamically construct and execute Cypher queries against the `bimba_map` based on the input user data to retrieve relevant universal symbolic information, correspondences, and interpretations.
*   **AC4 (Backend - Synthesis Logic - Basic):** Initial logic is implemented to synthesize or filter the results from the `bimba_map` based on the user's context. For example, if querying for tarot card meanings, the interpretation might be nuanced by the user's dominant element from their Jungian type.
*   **AC5 (Backend - API for Agent Subsystems):** An internal API or interface is exposed by this service layer that other agent subsystems (e.g., Oracle, Journal) can call to get personalized symbolic insights for a given user.
*   **AC6 (Performance):** The interaction layer is performant, ensuring that personalized insights can be generated without undue delay.
*   **AC7 (Documentation):** The design of the service layer, its interaction patterns, and the API it exposes are documented.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Backend - Design):** Design the architecture of the interaction service layer. Define its responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and how it will communicate with both MongoDB (for Mahamaya Matrix) and Neo4j (for `bimba_map`).
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend - Implementation - Data Retrieval):** Implement functions within the service layer to retrieve necessary data from a user's Mahamaya Matrix.
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend - Implementation - Query Construction):** Implement logic to dynamically construct Cypher queries for the `bimba_map` based on the retrieved user data.
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend - Implementation - Bimba Map Interaction):** Implement functions to execute these Cypher queries against Neo4j and process the results.
*   **Task 3.5 (Backend - Implementation - Synthesis Logic):** Develop initial algorithms or rules for synthesizing personalized insights by combining user-specific data with universal `bimba_map` data.
*   **Task 3.6 (Backend - API Development):** Develop the internal API or service interfaces that other parts of the Nara application (especially agent subsystems) will use to request personalized symbolic information.
*   **Task 3.7 (Backend - Testing):** Write unit and integration tests for the service layer, focusing on:
    *   Correct retrieval of user data.
    *   Accurate construction and execution of Cypher queries.
    *   Meaningful synthesis of personalized results.
    *   Performance of the interaction flow.
*   **Task 3.8 (Documentation):** Document the interaction layer's architecture, data flows, and the API for agent subsystems.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Service-Oriented Approach:** This layer acts as a crucial bridge. A clean, well-defined service interface is important.
*   **Complexity of Synthesis:** The synthesis logic can range from simple filtering to complex inferencing. Start with clear, manageable rules and plan for iterative refinement.
*   **Caching:** Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed `bimba_map` data or common synthesized insights to improve performance, especially if `bimba_map` queries are complex.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is needed for cases where data might be missing in either the Mahamaya Matrix or the `bimba_map`, or if queries fail.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Interactions with two different databases will likely involve asynchronous operations. Manage these effectively (e.g., using Promises/Async-Await in Node.js).
*   **Modularity:** Design the synthesis rules in a modular way so that new rules or refinements can be added easily as Nara's intelligence evolves.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Story E1.F2.S1 (Backend System for Mahamaya Matrix), providing access to user-specific data.
*   Completion of Story E1.F2.S2 (Bimba Map Foundation), providing the universal symbolic knowledge base.
*   A clear definition of initial use cases for personalization (e.g., how the Oracle or Journal will use this layer).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Accuracy of Personalization:** The synthesized insights should be demonstrably relevant to the user's Mahamaya Matrix.
*   **Responsiveness:** The system should provide personalized insights in a timely manner.
*   **Maintainability:** The logic for interaction and synthesis should be understandable and maintainable.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The agent subsystems (Oracle, Journal) will have clearly defined needs for personalized symbolic data that this layer can fulfill.
*   **Question:** What are the first few specific examples of personalized insights that this layer needs to support? (e.g., "For a user with Sun in Aries and Gene Key X, what is a relevant I Ching hexagram interpretation from the `bimba_map`?").
*   **Question:** How will conflicts or ambiguities in symbolic correspondences (if any exist in the `bimba_map`) be resolved during synthesis?

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
