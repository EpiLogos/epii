# Story 1.6: I Ching - The 64 Archetypal Situations of Psychological Transformation

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Implement the Six Nested Layers of #0 (Mahamaya Ground)
**Sub-Feature:** I Ching (The 64 Hexagrams of Change)
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story focuses on integrating the I Ching (Book of Changes). From a Jungian viewpoint, the 64 hexagrams represent a profound system of archetypal situations and transformative processes that mirror the psyche's dynamic interplay of conscious and unconscious forces. Associating the user's core patterns with hexagrams offers insights into recurring themes, challenges, and potentials for growth on their individuation journey. This layer helps understand the patterns of change relevant to the user's path towards integrating the Self.

The goal is to implement backend logic to determine primary I Ching hexagram(s) and UI elements to display this, framing interpretations to foster self-reflection on these universal psycho-spiritual dynamics.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Backend - Archetypal Hexagram Determination):** Based on birth data and cross-referencing with Gene Keys/Human Design Gates (which map to the 64 archetypes), the system determines primary I Ching hexagrams. These hexagrams symbolize key archetypal situations or developmental stages in the user's individuation process.
    *   *Developer Note: The method for deriving the hexagram needs to be clearly defined. It could be linked to the natal chart (e.g., specific planetary positions mapped to hexagrams), or directly from Gene Keys/Human Design gates which already have a 1:1 correspondence with the 64 hexagrams.*
*   **AC2 (Backend - Data Storage):** The determined I Ching hexagram(s) and any associated derived information (e.g., changing lines if applicable, though this might be an enhancement) are stored in the user's profile in MongoDB, as part of their Mahamaya Ground data.
*   **AC3 (Backend - Jungian-Infused Interpretation Content):** The system accesses interpretations for the 64 hexagrams. These interpretations will be enriched with Jungian psychological perspectives, highlighting themes of archetypal expression, shadow integration, synchronicity, and the journey towards wholeness. They will also subtly nod to deeper spiritual philosophies like Kashmir Saivism where appropriate, connecting the patterns of change to underlying consciousness.
*   **AC4 (UI - Display Archetypal Situation):** Within 
*   **AC5 (UI - Display Reflective Interpretation):** The UI displays interpretations that encourage introspection on how these universal patterns of change and transformation manifest personally, offering insights into the user's psychological processes and individuation path. The language will be reflective and non-prescriptive.
*   **AC6 (UI - Integration with Mahamaya Ground):** The I Ching display is visually and functionally integrated into the Mahamaya Ground interface, consistent with `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **AC7 (Responsiveness):** The I Ching display is responsive and functions correctly across defined breakpoints as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **AC8 (Accessibility):** The I Ching display adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), providing alternatives or clear descriptions for visual hexagram representations, as per `ui-ux-spec.md`.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (Research/Backend):** Define and document the precise methodology for deriving the user's primary I Ching hexagram(s) from their birth data or other Mahamaya Ground layers (e.g., direct mapping from Gene Key or Human Design Gate).
*   **Task 3.2 (Backend):** Implement the backend logic to determine the I Ching hexagram(s) based on the chosen methodology.
*   **Task 3.3 (Backend):** Source or create a structured data store (e.g., JSON, database collection) for the interpretations of the 64 I Ching hexagrams. *Consider using a well-regarded public domain translation or commentary if licensing allows, or create proprietary interpretations aligned with Nara's philosophy.*
*   **Task 3.4 (Backend):** Design the schema and implement storage for the user's I Ching data in MongoDB.
*   **Task 3.5 (Backend):** Develop an API endpoint to retrieve the I Ching hexagram(s) and interpretation(s) for a user.
*   **Task 3.6 (Frontend):** Design and develop the UI components to display the I Ching hexagram visually (the six lines).
*   **Task 3.7 (Frontend):** Design and develop UI elements to display the name/number of the hexagram and its interpretation.
*   **Task 3.8 (Frontend):** Integrate the frontend components with the backend API.
*   **Task 3.9 (Testing):** Write unit tests for backend hexagram determination logic. Test UI components for accuracy, responsiveness, and accessibility. Validate interpretations are correctly displayed.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Hexagram Derivation & Archetypal Mapping:** Direct mapping from Gene Keys/Human Design Gates is preferred, as these already embody the 64 archetypal principles. This ensures consistency in how these foundational archetypes are presented across different symbolic layers of the Mahamaya Ground, reinforcing their connection to the user's core psychic structure.
*   **Interpretation Source & Psychological Depth:** Interpretations will be crafted locally or adapted from sources that lend themselves to a depth psychological (Jungian) and psycho-spiritual reading, aligning with Nara's philosophical orientation. The focus will be on the symbolic meaning for personal growth and self-understanding.
*   **Visual Representation:** Displaying the hexagram (broken and unbroken lines) is relatively simple. Ensure it's clear and aesthetically pleasing.
*   **UI/UX & Navigating Inner Change:** Refer to `ui-ux-spec.md`. The I Ching display should help the user understand and navigate the patterns of psychological change and transformation in their life, viewing them as opportunities for growth and integration on their individuation journey.
*   **BPMCP Integration & Synchronistic Patterns:** I Ching hexagram data, representing archetypal situations, will be part of the `bimba_map`. This allows for exploring potential synchronistic connections between the user's inner state (reflected by the hexagram) and outer events or other symbolic layers.
*   **Future Enhancements & Active Imagination:** Future features could include an oracle function for casting hexagrams, framed as a tool for active imagination and dialogue with the unconscious, to gain insight into current life situations from an archetypal perspective.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Story 1.1 (Birthdate Encoding).
*   Potentially Story 1.4 (Gene Keys) or Story 1.5 (Human Design) if the derivation method relies on them.
*   A chosen source for I Ching hexagram interpretations.
*   Access to `ui-ux-spec.md` for design guidelines.
*   Access to `epic-1.md` for feature context.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Accuracy:** Hexagram determination (if not a direct mapping) must be accurate according to the chosen methodology.
*   **Content Integrity:** Interpretations must be faithfully represented.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** A clear, defined method for linking a user to one or more primary I Ching hexagrams will be established (likely via Gene Keys/Human Design).
*   **Question:** Which specific I Ching translation/commentary will be used for interpretations? Are there licensing considerations?
*   **Question:** Will this initial implementation focus on a single primary hexagram, or allow for multiple (e.g., conscious/unconscious, or from different calculation points)? *Initial scope should be well-defined.*

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.

**Next Steps:** Review against `story-draft-checklist.md`. This completes the initial stories for the "Implement the Six Nested Layers of #0 (Mahamaya Ground)" feature of Epic 1. The next step will be to move to the next feature in Epic 1 or to Epic 4 if all features of Epic 1 are covered.
