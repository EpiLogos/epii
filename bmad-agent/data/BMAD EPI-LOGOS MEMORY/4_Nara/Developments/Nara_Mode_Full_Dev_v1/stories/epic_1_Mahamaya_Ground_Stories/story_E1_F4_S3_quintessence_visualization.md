# Story E1.F4.S3: Frontend - Archetypal Quintessence Dynamic Visualization

**Context:** 4_Nara / Nara_Mode_Full_Dev_v1
**Epic:** Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground Implementation: The 64-Fold Archetypal Foundation
**Feature:** Frontend Expression & Visualization
**Sub-Feature:** Dynamic and Interactive Visualization of the Archetypal Quintessence
**AI Builder Target:** Augment Code (Claude 4)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Story Description & Goal

This story addresses the requirement from `epic-1.md` for the Archetypal Quintessence to be presented as a "dynamic, interactive sigil or glyph or mock-tarot card or mandala" within the "Identity Dynamics" section. This goes beyond the initial reveal during onboarding (Story E1.F3.S5) and focuses on how the Quintessence is experienced as an ongoing, explorable part of the user's profile.

The goal is to design and implement a rich, interactive visualization for the user's Archetypal Quintessence. This visualization should not only display the synthesized persona (e.g., custom tarot card, glyph) but also allow users to explore its constituent layers and understand how they contribute to the whole, potentially revealing deeper insights upon interaction.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1 (Frontend - UI/UX Design):** A detailed UI/UX design for the interactive Quintessence visualization is created, consistent with `ui-ux-spec.md` and the nature of the Quintessence (e.g., tarot card, sigil, mandala).
*   **AC2 (Frontend - Core Visual Display):** The primary visual representation of the Archetypal Quintessence (e.g., the custom tarot card image, the dynamic sigil) is prominently and attractively displayed within its dedicated area in the "Identity Dynamics" section.
*   **AC3 (Frontend - Interactive Exploration):** Users can interact with the Quintessence visualization to explore its components. For example, clicking/hovering on parts of a mandala could highlight contributing Mahamaya Ground layers, or a tarot card could have interactive hotspots.
*   **AC4 (Frontend - Layer Revelation):** Interactions with the Quintessence reveal connections to or summaries of the underlying Mahamaya Ground layers (Astrology, Jungian Type, Gene Keys, Human Design, I Ching) that formed it.
*   **AC5 (Frontend - Dynamic Aspects - Optional/Future):** The visualization may include subtle dynamic elements (e.g., gentle animations, shifting patterns) that respond to user interaction or reflect the living nature of the Quintessence. This is a potential enhancement.
*   **AC6 (Backend - Data Integration):** The frontend retrieves all necessary data for the Quintessence and its constituent parts from the backend (Mahamaya Matrix).
*   **AC7 (Frontend - Explanatory Text):** Accompanying text provides context and guidance on how to interact with and interpret the Quintessence visualization.
*   **AC8 (Responsiveness & Accessibility):** The Quintessence visualization is responsive and adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), ensuring usability for all users.

## 3. Tasks

*   **Task 3.1 (UX Design - Interaction Model):** Define the interaction model for the Quintessence visualization. How do users explore it? What information is revealed at different levels of interaction? Create wireframes/prototypes. Refer to `ui-ux-spec.md`.
*   **Task 3.2 (UI Design - Visual Concept):** Develop the detailed visual design for the Quintessence (e.g., if it's a mandala, design its segments and symbols; if a tarot card, define interactive zones). This builds upon the Quintessence design from Story 1.7.
*   **Task 3.3 (Frontend - Component Development):** Implement the core UI component for the Quintessence visualization (e.g., using SVG, Canvas, or a combination of HTML/CSS for interactivity).
*   **Task 3.4 (Frontend - Data Binding):** Bind the visualization to the user's Archetypal Quintessence data and the data of its contributing Mahamaya Ground layers.
*   **Task 3.5 (Frontend - Interaction Logic):** Implement the logic for user interactions (clicks, hovers, etc.) and the corresponding display changes or information reveals.
*   **Task 3.6 (Frontend - Animation - Optional):** If dynamic aspects are included, implement these animations.
*   **Task 3.7 (Frontend - Content Integration):** Integrate explanatory text and tooltips to guide the user's exploration.
*   **Task 3.8 (Testing):** Thoroughly test the visualization's interactivity, data accuracy, performance, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## 4. Technical Guidance & Considerations

*   **Visualization Technology:** Choose appropriate technology based on the complexity and interactivity required (e.g., SVG for scalable vector graphics and interactivity, HTML/CSS for simpler layouts, Canvas for more complex rendering or pixel-level manipulation).
*   **Performance:** Interactive visualizations can be resource-intensive. Optimize for smooth performance, especially on less powerful devices.
*   **Information Density:** Balance richness of information with clarity. Avoid overwhelming the user.
*   **Intuitive Interaction:** Interactions should be intuitive and discoverable.
*   **Connection to Story 1.7:** The visual form of the Quintessence (tarot card, glyph, etc.) was initially defined in Story 1.7. This story elaborates on its interactive presentation.
*   **Accessibility for Complex Visuals:** Pay special attention to making complex interactive visuals accessible (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, alternative text descriptions).

## 5. Dependencies

*   Completion of Story 1.7 (Archetypal Quintessence - Synthesis) for the definition and backend generation of the Quintessence.
*   Completion of Story E1.F4.S1 (Identity Dynamics Dashboard) as this visualization will reside within that dashboard.
*   Availability of backend APIs to retrieve detailed Quintessence data and related Mahamaya Ground layer summaries.
*   `ui-ux-spec.md` for overall UI/UX guidelines.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Engaging & Insightful:** The visualization should encourage exploration and lead to deeper understanding for the user.
*   **Aesthetically Coherent:** Must align with the overall Nara aesthetic and the symbolic nature of the Quintessence.
*   **Performant:** Interactions should be fluid and responsive.

## 7. Open Questions/Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** The specific visual form of the Quintessence (tarot card, sigil, mandala) has been determined in earlier design stages (related to Story 1.7 and `ui-ux-spec.md`).
*   **Question:** What is the desired level of interactivity and depth of exploration for the Quintessence visualization initially? (MVP vs. ideal state).
*   **Question:** How are the "layers revealed as the user explores deeper" practically implemented? (e.g., pop-ups, side panels, highlighting connections).

## 8. Progress Notes & Iterations

*   **[Date] - v0.1:** Initial draft created by EpiLogos Story Steward.
