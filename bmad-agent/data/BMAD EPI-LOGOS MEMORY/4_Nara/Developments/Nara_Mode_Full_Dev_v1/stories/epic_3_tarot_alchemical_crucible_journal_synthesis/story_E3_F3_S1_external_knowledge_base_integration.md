# User Story: E3_F3_S1 - External Knowledge Base Integration for Symbolic Enrichment (Jungian & Saivist Informed)

**Epic:** 3 - Tarot-Alchemical Crucible & Journal Synthesis
**Feature:** F3 - Integration with External Knowledge Bases - The Alchemical Library
**Story ID:** E3_F3_S1

**As a** User seeking deeper understanding of symbols and themes emerging in my journal or Oracle readings, recognizing these as expressions of my individuation journey and manifestations of universal Consciousness (Paramashiva),
**I want** Nara to be able to query curated external knowledge bases (e.g., APIs for mythology, symbology, `sacred-texts.com` archives, academic resources) when a symbol or theme is identified, providing cultural amplifications and archetypal parallels from diverse traditions,
**So that** I can access a broader range of interpretations, historical context, and cross-cultural associations, enriching my personal insights by connecting them to the collective unconscious and witnessing the multifaceted play of Cit-Shakti across different symbolic languages.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Identification of Queryable Symbols/Themes (Archetypal Resonance):** The system (building on E3_F2_S1 and E3_F2_S2) must identify symbols, archetypes (e.g., the Hero, the Great Mother), mythological figures, or key themes from journal entries or Oracle readings that resonate with universal patterns and are suitable for external lookup to explore their diverse cultural expressions.
2.  **Curated List of External Knowledge Bases:**
    *   Define an initial set of reliable and relevant external knowledge bases (e.g., specific APIs, structured access to archives like `sacred-texts.com`), chosen for their depth in comparative mythology, symbology, and spiritual traditions, reflecting the unity in diversity of human experience of the sacred.
    *   Establish protocols for querying these bases (API keys, rate limits, data parsing).
3.  **Query Formulation and Execution:**
    *   Nara must be able to formulate effective search queries based on the identified symbol/theme.
    *   The system should execute these queries against the selected external knowledge bases.
4.  **Data Retrieval and Parsing:**
    *   Successfully retrieve data from the external sources.
    *   Parse the retrieved data (which may be in various formats like JSON, XML, HTML) to extract relevant information (e.g., definitions, myths, cultural associations, textual excerpts that illuminate the symbol's role in different expressions of consciousness).
5.  **Presentation of Enriched Information:**
    *   Present the supplementary information to the user in a clear, concise, and integrated manner within the Nara UI (e.g., as an expandable section in the journal, or as additional details in an Oracle reading interpretation), encouraging contemplation on how these universal themes manifest personally.
    *   Properly attribute the source of the information.
6.  **Relevance Filtering & Thematic Coherence:** Implement mechanisms to filter or rank the retrieved information for relevance to the user's context and the specific archetypal/symbolic thread being explored, avoiding information overload and fostering coherent understanding of how different traditions illuminate aspects of the Self and universal Consciousness.
7.  **User Interface for Accessing External Info:** The UI should make it clear when information is being drawn from an external source and provide links to the original source if possible and appropriate.
8.  **Error Handling and Fallbacks:** Gracefully handle cases where external sources are unavailable or return no relevant information.
9.  **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure compliance with terms of service for any external APIs or data sources. Avoid misrepresenting retrieved information as Nara's own primary interpretation.

**Dependencies:**

*   Journal Synthesis Engine (Feature E3_F2) for identifying symbols/themes.
*   Oracle reading interpretation modules.
*   UI components for displaying enriched information.

**Notes:**

*   This feature acts as an "Alchemical Library," expanding the symbolic resources available to the user, helping them to see their personal journey mirrored in the collective human story and the diverse expressions of divine wisdom (Prajna/Jnana Shakti).
*   The focus is on providing supplementary, contextual information for cultural amplification and recognizing archetypal parallels, not replacing Nara's core interpretive logic or the `bimba_map`, but rather enriching them by showing the broader tapestry of human symbolic expression and its roots in universal Consciousness.
*   Initial implementation might focus on one or two well-structured external sources, with the ability to add more over time.
*   Consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed external data to improve performance and reduce API calls.
