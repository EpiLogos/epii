# User Story: E3_F1_S1 - Archetypal Concrescence Spreads for Oracle Readings (Jungian & Saivist Informed)

**Epic:** 3 - Tarot-Alchemical Crucible & Journal Synthesis
**Feature:** F1 - Advanced Oracle Reading Modes - The Alchemical Catalyst
**Story ID:** E3_F1_S1

**As a** User seeking Oracle guidance relevant to my current phase of psychospiritual development (Individuation, informed by Jungian psychology) and the subtle unfolding of consciousness (informed by Kashmir Saivism),
**I want** to be able to use 6-card Tarot layouts ("Archetypal Concrescence Spreads") that automatically configure based on my current 12-fold concrescence phase (e.g., the emergence of a new archetypal constellation vs. the integration of shadow aspects, determined by Mahamaya Ground and ongoing journey reflecting the dance of Shiva-Shakti),
**So that** the Oracle readings are specifically tailored to the archetypal dynamics, energetic themes (Spanda), and developmental tasks of my present state of being and becoming.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Archetypal Concrescence Phase Determination:** The system must be able to discern the user's current 12-fold concrescence phase, understood as a stage in their individuation journey and a particular expression of the universal play of consciousness. This likely involves:
    *   Accessing relevant archetypal and energetic data from the user's Mahamaya Ground (Epic 1), reflecting their unique psychic constitution.
    *   Potentially tracking user progress or self-identified shifts in awareness within Nara, acknowledging the subjective experience of inner transformation.
    *   Mapping this phase to one of the 12 concrescence stages (e.g., Sum Value 1 through 12, or named phases like Archetypal Emergence, Shadow Encounter, Integration of Opposites, Self-Realization, etc.), each representing a distinct configuration of psychic energies.
2.  **Archetypal Spread Configuration Logic:** A system must be in place to define multiple 6-card Tarot spread layouts, each resonating with the archetypal dynamics of a specific concrescence phase or group of phases.
    *   This includes defining the symbolic inquiry or archetypal theme for each card position within the spread, guiding the user's contemplation.
    *   The configuration should consider the elemental, numerological, or primary archetypal signature of the concrescence phase (e.g., a phase characterized by the archetype of the Hermit, or an Air-related phase like Sum Value 8, might use a spread emphasizing introspection, intellectual clarification, or the Swords suit as symbolic of mental processes and discernment).
3.  **Automatic Archetypal Spread Selection:** When the user initiates an Oracle reading and chooses (or is guided to) an Archetypal Concrescence Spread, the system automatically selects and presents the layout that best reflects the archetypal energies of their current determined phase.
4.  **UI for Spread Display:** The selected 6-card spread must be clearly displayed in the Oracle UI, with each card position labeled according to its defined meaning in that specific spread configuration.
5.  **Card Drawing and Symbolic Interpretation:** The user can draw cards for each position, and interpretations should be contextualized by the position's archetypal theme within the phase-specific spread, inviting a deeper understanding of the psyche's messages.
6.  **Clarity of Archetypal Phase Connection:** The UI should subtly indicate or explain, in evocative language, why this particular spread configuration was chosen, linking it to the user's current archetypal concrescence phase and its significance for their journey of self-discovery.
7.  **Variety of Archetypal Spreads:** A sufficient variety of Archetypal Concrescence Spreads should be developed to cover the 12 phases meaningfully, reflecting the diverse ways archetypal energies manifest, potentially with some spreads serving multiple related phases or nuances of a single phase.

**Dependencies:**

*   Mahamaya Ground data (Epic 1) to provide input for concrescence phase determination.
*   A defined model of the 12-fold concrescence cycle and its characteristics.
*   UI/UX design for selecting and displaying these dynamic spreads.
*   Oracle card drawing and interpretation engine (from Epic 2 and earlier).
*   `bimba_map` might inform the design of spreads by linking phases to specific symbols or archetypes.

**Notes:**

*   The concept of the "12-fold archetypal concrescence phase" needs clear definition, rooted in Jungian developmental stages and Saivist principles of cosmic unfolding, and a method for its discernment within the system.
*   This feature aims to make Oracle readings more dynamically resonant with the user's evolving individuation journey and their deepening recognition of the Self (Atman).
*   Initial implementation might focus on a few key phases and their corresponding spreads, with more added over time.
*   The example "Sum Value 8 (an Air-related phase)" suggests a numerological, elemental, or direct archetypal basis for phase characterization that needs to be consistently applied, drawing from established symbolic systems and the core philosophies.
