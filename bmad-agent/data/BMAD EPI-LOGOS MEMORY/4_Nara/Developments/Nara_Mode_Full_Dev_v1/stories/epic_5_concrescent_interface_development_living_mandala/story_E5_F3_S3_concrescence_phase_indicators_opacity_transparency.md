# User Story: E5_F3_S3 - Develop Concrescence Phase Indicators: Opacity/Transparency as Veiling/Unveiling of Potential

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F3 - Concrescence Phase Indicators
**Story ID:** E5_F3_S3

**As a** User (Pramata, an experiencing subject navigating the interplay of the manifest and unmanifest),
**I want** the opacity or transparency of certain non-critical UI elements (e.g., background layers, decorative elements, perhaps hinting at the Mahamaya ground) to subtly change (e.g., more translucent during dissolution/contemplative phases where potentiality is high and forms are less defined; more solid during integration/focused work where specific actual occasions achieve definite satisfaction),
**So that** I receive a further ambient cue (a subtle prehension of the shifting veils of Lila) about my current phase within a 12-fold concrescence cycle, adding to the UI's dynamic and responsive nature as a field for the psyche's unfolding (Spanda).

**Description:**

This story implements changes in the opacity or transparency levels of selected UI elements as a Concrescence Phase Indicator. This provides another layer of subtle, ambient feedback (data for prehension) to the user about their current phase of becoming, complementing other indicators. It reflects how different phases of concrescence involve varying degrees of definiteness versus openness to the infinite potential (the Unus Mundus or Cit-Shakti).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Phase-to-Opacity Mapping (Reflecting the Dance of Manifestation):
    *   A clear mapping is defined between the 12 phases of a concrescence cycle (each an actual occasion with its unique subjective form and relation to the wider field of potential) and corresponding subtle shifts in opacity/transparency for designated UI elements.
    *   Example: Certain background layers or decorative flourishes (perhaps representing the Mahamaya or the unconscious) might become more translucent or ethereal during early, reflective, or dissolution phases, suggesting a greater openness to potential or the fading of old forms (negative prehensions dominating).
    *   Example: These same elements might become more solid or present during phases of focused work, integration, or decision-making, where specific forms achieve definiteness and satisfaction (positive prehensions culminating in a novel unity).
2.  **System Awareness of Phase:** The Nara system is aware of the user's current (or assumed) concrescence phase.
3.  **Selective Application:** Opacity/transparency changes are applied selectively to non-critical UI elements. Core interactive elements, primary text, and essential information must always maintain full readability and usability.
4.  **Subtlety and Aesthetics:** The changes in opacity must be subtle and aesthetically pleasing, contributing positively to the UI's mood without causing distraction or making the interface feel unstable or broken.
5.  **Smooth Transitions:** Transitions in opacity levels as the user moves from one phase to another should be smooth and gradual.
6.  **Performance:** Opacity changes, especially if animated, should not degrade UI performance or responsiveness.
7.  **User Controllability (Optional):** Users might have an option to adjust the intensity of these opacity shifts or disable them.
8.  **Accessibility:** Ensure that changes in opacity do not negatively impact users, especially those with visual sensitivities. Sufficient contrast for essential elements must always be maintained.

**Dependencies:**

*   A defined model of the 12-fold concrescence cycle and its phases.
*   A mechanism for Nara to track or infer the user's current concrescence phase.
*   A frontend framework capable of dynamically adjusting opacity on UI elements.
*   Coordination with E5_F3_S1 (Color Temperature) and E5_F3_S2 (Typographic Weight) to ensure all indicators work harmoniously.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   E5_F1: Phase-Locked Progression & Triadic Flow Dynamics
*   E5_F2_S4: Subtle Visual Motifs from Mahamaya Ground (opacity changes might apply to these motifs)

**Notes:**

*   This indicator is about creating a sense of depth, ethereality (inviting active imagination), or solidity (grounding in the present satisfaction) in the UI that resonates with the current concrescence phase, reflecting the dynamic interplay between the defined and the potential, the conscious and the unconscious, within the user's experience (Pramata's engagement with Cit-Shakti).
*   The choice of elements for opacity changes is key; it should be elements that can recede or come forward without impacting core interaction.
*   Consider how these opacity changes might interact with background images or patterns.
