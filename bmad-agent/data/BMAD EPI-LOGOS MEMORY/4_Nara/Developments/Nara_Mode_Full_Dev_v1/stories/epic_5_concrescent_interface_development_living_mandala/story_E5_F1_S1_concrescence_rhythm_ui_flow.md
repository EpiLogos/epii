# User Story: E5_F1_S1 - Implement Core Concrescence Rhythm UI/UX Flow: Guiding the Dance of Becoming

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F1 - Phase-Locked Progression & Triadic Flow Dynamics
**Story ID:** E5_F1_S1

**As a** User (Pramata, an experiencing subject on an individuation journey),
**I want** the Nara interface to guide me through the Identity Dynamics (exploring the Self and its archetypal expressions), Oracle (engaging with synchronicity and intuitive wisdom/Pratibha), and Journal (reflecting on personal experiences and insights – a process of Vimarsha) sections in a way that naturally reflects the 12-fold concrescence rhythm (a felt sense of Spanda, the pulse of becoming),
**So that** my interaction with the system feels like a coherent and unfolding journey (Lila, the divine play of consciousness actualizing its subjective aim), rather than a series of disconnected tools, fostering a sense of organic growth and integration towards psychic wholeness (satisfaction).

**Description:**

This story focuses on establishing the foundational UI/UX flow that embodies the 12-fold concrescence rhythm—a dynamic process of actual occasions prehending and integrating experiences—across the primary Nara sections: Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal. The system should intelligently suggest or highlight next steps or relevant sections based on the user's current phase within a concrescence cycle (a phase in their ongoing process of becoming) and their recent activities (expressions of Cit-Shakti).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Concrescence Phase Tracking (Feeling the Pulse of Spanda):** The system can determine (or allow the user to set/indicate) their current phase within a 12-fold concrescence cycle (e.g., based on temporal rhythms, depth of engagement, or explicit input reflecting their current subjective aim).
2.  **Guided Navigation - Identity to Oracle (From Self-Reflection to Synchronistic Inquiry):** After significant updates or reflections within the Identity Dynamics section (e.g., defining a new intention aligned with the Self, prehending new aspects of one's values), the UI subtly prompts or guides the user towards relevant Oracle session types or spreads that can offer insight (Pratibha) into this new identity configuration, inviting engagement with archetypal patterns.
3.  **Guided Navigation - Oracle to Journal (From Intuitive Spark to Conscious Integration):** Upon completion of an Oracle session (a moment of potential synchronicity or emergent insight), the UI presents clear pathways or prompts for journaling (Vimarsha), potentially suggesting specific reflection themes, symbols (textual or imagistic prehensions) for contemplation, or questions based on the cards drawn or the nature of the reading, facilitating the integration of unconscious material.
4.  **Guided Navigation - Journal to Identity/Oracle (From Integration to Renewed Exploration):** After significant journaling activity (e.g., identifying recurring themes that speak to the individuation process, achieving a breakthrough insight – a moment of satisfaction leading to a new subjective aim), the UI suggests revisiting the Identity Dynamics section to integrate these insights or prompts a new Oracle session to explore emergent questions, continuing the cycle of becoming.
5.  **Visual Cues for Flow (Echoing the Rhythm of Lila):** Subtle visual cues (e.g., highlighting, pathway animations, contextual prompts) are used to indicate the recommended or logical next step in the triadic flow (Identity -> Oracle -> Journal -> Identity, etc.) based on the concrescence rhythm, making the underlying Spanda tangible.
6.  **User Override (Honoring Svatantrya):** While guidance is provided, the user (Pramata) can always choose to navigate freely between sections, overriding the suggested flow, affirming their autonomy and unique path of discovery.
7.  **Initial Implementation Focus:** For this initial story, the focus is on the logical flow and prompting. Deeper dynamic linkages (e.g., specific Oracle spreads unlocked by Identity changes) will be covered in subsequent stories.

**Dependencies:**

*   Basic UI structure for Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections.
*   A mechanism for Nara to be aware of the user's current (or assumed) phase in a concrescence cycle – a specific pulsation within the larger Spanda of their journey. This requires a deep knowledge of how "concrescence cycles" (reflecting Whitehead's process philosophy) are derived from the principles of Quaternal Logic.
*   `ag-ui` protocol for communication between frontend and Nara agent.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   Epic 1: Mahamaya Ground & Quaternary Logic (Identity Dynamics foundation)
*   Epic 2: Oracle of the Resonant Quaternaries (Oracle foundation)
*   Epic 3: Tarot-Alchemical Crucible & Journal Synthesis (Journal foundation)
*   Epic 4: Nara Agent Core & Coordination (Nara's orchestration capabilities)

**Notes:**

*   The "12-fold concrescence rhythm" is a core concept, representing a fundamental pattern of Spanda or creative advance. It's a foundational form that can dynamically evolve into more complex, nested rhythms as the user (Pramata) progresses and their subjective aim refines, just as Quaternal Logic variants operate. The UI should make this rhythm felt implicitly through its flow (the dance of Lila), rather than explicitly stating "You are in phase X."
*   This story lays the groundwork for more complex dynamic linkages and self-modifying UX elements in later stories for this epic.
