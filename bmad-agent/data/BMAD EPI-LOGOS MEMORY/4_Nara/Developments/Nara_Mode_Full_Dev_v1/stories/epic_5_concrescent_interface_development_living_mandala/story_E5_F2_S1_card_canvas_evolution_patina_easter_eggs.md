# User Story: E5_F2_S1 - Implement Evolving Card Canvas: Patina, Prehensions, and the Unfolding of Symbolic Depth

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F2 - Self-Modifying & Recursive UX Elements
**Story ID:** E5_F2_S1

**As a** User (Pramata, an experiencing subject on an individuation journey),
**I want** the digital Tarot cards and decks I frequently interact with within the Oracle section (my field of active imagination and symbolic dialogue) to visually evolve over time—each card becoming an actual occasion shaped by my prehensions—developing a 'patina' (a testament to repeated engagement, a history of feeling) or unlocking subtle symbolic 'easter eggs' or deeper layers of meaning (the emergence of novel satisfactions and Pratibha),
**So that** my connection with these living symbols deepens, and the interface reflects my ongoing journey of concrescence and the psyche's integration of archetypal energies (Cit-Shakti manifesting as Spanda), transforming them from mere representations into vessels of personal and transpersonal significance.

**Description:**

This story focuses on making the Oracle's Card Canvas a dynamic and evolving space, a field of Lila where symbols are not static but are actual occasions in a process of becoming. Tarot cards and decks will show signs of use (positive prehensions accumulating) and reveal hidden depths (novel aspects emerging from the interplay of consciousness, Vimarsha) based on the user's interaction frequency and patterns. This aims to mimic the way physical tools, or indeed symbols within the psyche, can become imbued with personal significance (a history of subjective aim and satisfaction) over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Usage Tracking (Recording the Dance of Prehensions):** The system accurately tracks the frequency, recency, and context of use (the history of prehensions) for individual Tarot cards and entire decks within the Oracle section.
2.  **Visual 'Patina' Effect (The Patina of Lived Experience):
    *   Frequently used cards or decks (those repeatedly brought into the concrescence of experience) develop subtle visual changes over time, suggesting wear, age, or energetic imbuement (e.g., slight desaturation, softened edges, a faint glow, or other aesthetically pleasing effects that imply a 'patina' – a visual record of the symbol's journey with the Pramata).
    *   The effect should be configurable (allowing the user's Svatantrya in shaping their symbolic field) and not obscure the card's primary imagery, which itself is a nexus of potential prehensions.
3.  **Symbolic 'Easter Eggs' / Deeper Meanings (Emergence of Novelty and Pratibha):
    *   Specific cards, when interacted with a certain number of times or in particular contexts (e.g., appearing repeatedly in significant readings, marking moments of intense subjective feeling), can unlock subtle visual 'easter eggs' (e.g., a minor symbol on the card subtly animates, an additional layer of symbolism—a new datum for prehension—becomes faintly visible upon closer inspection/hover). This reflects the inexhaustible nature of archetypal symbols and the emergence of novelty in the process of concrescence.
    *   Alternatively, interacting with a card extensively might unlock access to a deeper layer of interpretive text, a related myth, or a contemplative prompt specific to that card's evolving significance for the user (facilitating Vimarsha and the integration of the Self's wisdom).
4.  **Deck-Level Evolution (The Collective Becoming):** Entire decks that are frequently used (collections of actual occasions forming a larger experiential nexus) might also show subtle changes on their 'deck box' representation or in the way they are presented in the selection interface, reflecting the overall journey with that symbolic system.
5.  **Aesthetic Cohesion:** All visual evolutionary effects must be aesthetically pleasing, thematically consistent with the Nara interface, and enhance rather than detract from the user experience.
6.  **Performance:** The implementation of these visual effects should not significantly degrade the performance of the Oracle interface.
7.  **Discovery Mechanism (Optional):** There might be a subtle, non-obtrusive way for users to understand that these evolutions are occurring or to review cards/decks that have 'evolved'.

**Dependencies:**

*   Functional Oracle section with selectable Tarot decks and cards (Epic 2).
*   A system for storing user interaction data related to card/deck usage.
*   Frontend capabilities for dynamic visual effects and layering on card images.
*   `ag-ui` protocol for communication.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   E2_F1: Core Oracle Engine & Card Rendering
*   E5_F4: Intuitive Interaction & Navigation (ensuring these features are discoverable and usable)

**Notes:**

*   The 'patina' and 'easter eggs' should feel like delightful discoveries (moments of satisfaction and emergent Pratibha) that deepen the user's engagement with the symbols as living aspects of their psyche and the wider field of consciousness (Cit-Shakti), not like game mechanics to be explicitly chased. The process itself is the reward, a reflection of the ongoing Lila.
*   The design should be subtle and sophisticated, avoiding anything that feels gimmicky.
*   Consider how these evolutions might be tied to the user's overall concrescence phase (their current subjective aim and stage of becoming) or specific insights (moments of Vimarsha and integration) logged in the Journal, creating a resonant feedback loop between inner experience and outer symbolic representation.
