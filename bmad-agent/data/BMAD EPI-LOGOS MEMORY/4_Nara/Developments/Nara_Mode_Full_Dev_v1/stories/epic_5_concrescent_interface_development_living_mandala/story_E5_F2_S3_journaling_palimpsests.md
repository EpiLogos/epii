# User Story: E5_F2_S3 - Implement Optional Journaling Palimpsests

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F2 - Self-Modifying & Recursive UX Elements
**Story ID:** E5_F2_S3

**As a** User,
**I want** the option to have previous journal entries faintly visible beneath my current entry, like a palimpsest,
**So that** I can subtly perceive thematic continuities, the evolution of my thoughts, or the layers of my reflections over time as I write.

**Description:**

This story introduces an optional visual feature for the Journaling section called "Journaling Palimpsests." When enabled, as a user types a new entry, the text of a previous, thematically related or chronologically preceding entry (or entries) can be displayed very faintly in the background, as if writing on a surface that has been used before. This aims to provide a subtle, ambient awareness of past reflections and how they connect to the present.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Toggleable Feature:** The palimpsest feature can be easily toggled on or off by the user in the Journal settings.
2.  **Selection of Background Entry/Entries:**
    *   The system should have a default logic for selecting which previous entry (or entries) appears as the palimpsest (e.g., the immediately preceding entry, an entry with high thematic similarity based on keywords or Nara's synthesis).
    *   Optionally, the user might have some control over this selection (e.g., choose to see entries from the same day last month/year, or entries tagged with a specific theme).
3.  **Visual Subtlety:** The text of the background entry/entries must be very faint and unobtrusive, ensuring it does not interfere with the readability of the current entry. The effect should be aesthetically pleasing and suggestive, not distracting.
4.  **Performance:** Displaying the palimpsest effect should not noticeably degrade the performance of the journaling interface, especially typing responsiveness.
5.  **Contextual Relevance (Advanced):** Ideally, the choice of which past entry to display could be influenced by the current Oracle reading, Identity focus, or emerging themes in the current journal entry itself, making the palimpsest contextually relevant.
6.  **Readability Controls:** Users might have controls for the opacity or intensity of the palimpsest effect to suit their visual preference.
7.  **No Data Obscurity:** The feature should never make current or past data hard to read or access directly when needed.

**Dependencies:**

*   Functional Journaling section (Epic 3).
*   Mechanism for storing and retrieving past journal entries.
*   (Optional, for advanced criteria) Nara's synthesis engine (Epic 4) for thematic analysis of journal entries.
*   Frontend capabilities for layered text display and opacity controls.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   E3_F2: Journal Synthesis Engine (for thematic linking)
*   E5_F4: Intuitive Interaction & Navigation (for settings access)

**Notes:**

*   The term 'palimpsest' itself evokes a sense of history and layered meaning, which is the core feeling this feature aims to provide.
*   This feature is about subtle evocation, not explicit data presentation. The primary focus remains on the current entry being written.
*   Consider privacy implications if multiple users might access the same device; this feature should be tied to the logged-in user's data.
