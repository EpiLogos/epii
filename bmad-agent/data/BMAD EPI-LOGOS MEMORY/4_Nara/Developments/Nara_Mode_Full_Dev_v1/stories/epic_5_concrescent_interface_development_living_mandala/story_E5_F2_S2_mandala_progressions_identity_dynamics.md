# User Story: E5_F2_S2 - Implement Evolving Mandala Progressions in Identity Dynamics

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F2 - Self-Modifying & Recursive UX Elements
**Story ID:** E5_F2_S2

**As a** User engaging with Nara over time and exploring my psyche through a Jungian lens,
**I want** my Living Mandala in the UI to subtly evolve, reflecting my individuation journey, key insights from Oracle readings (interpreted archetypally), themes from my Journal (including shadow work and dream analysis), and the synthesis of my Mahamaya Ground data (viewed as aspects of my total personality),
**So that** the Mandala becomes a dynamic, personalized visual representation of my ongoing psycho-spiritual development, the integration of unconscious contents, and the emergence of the Self within the Nara ecosystem.

**Description:**

This story focuses on making the Identity Dynamics section, particularly the visualization of the user's Mahamaya Ground (as defined in Epic 1), a dynamic and evolving representation. As the user interacts with Oracle readings and synthesizes insights in their Journal, these experiences should feed back into and visibly alter their personalized mandala or symbolic map, reflecting their inner development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Data Source Integration (Jungian Perspective):** The Living Mandala's evolution logic must be able to pull from and react to: Mahamaya Ground Quintessence (as a snapshot of the Self and its archetypal expressions), significant Oracle readings (interpreted for archetypal dynamics, e.g., shadow projection, anima/animus encounters), dominant themes/sentiments from Journal entries (especially those related to dream work, active imagination, and shadow integration), and user engagement with specific Nara features that promote self-reflection and integration of unconscious material.
2.  **Evolutionary Logic Definition (Individuation Path):** A clear set of rules or an algorithmic approach needs to be defined for how these data points influence the Mandala's visual characteristics. This logic should aim to symbolically represent key aspects of the Jungian individuation process, such as: the differentiation of the ego from the unconscious, the confrontation with the shadow, the integration of the anima/animus, and the progressive centering towards the Self. Visual changes (e.g., color shifts towards wholeness/integration, increasing symmetry or complexity, emergence of central unifying symbols) should reflect these psychological dynamics.
3.  **Visual Representation of Change (Symbolic of Psyche's Movement):** Changes in the Mandala should be subtle yet noticeable over time, reflecting the often non-linear and gradual nature of psychological development. The evolution should feel organic, symbolizing the psyche's movement towards wholeness and the integration of opposites, rather than abrupt or purely linear 'progress'.
4.  **Link to Identity Dynamics (Self and Archetypes):** The Living Mandala should be a central visual element within the "Identity Dynamics" section, closely tied to the Archetypal Quintessence (as an expression of the Self) and other representations of the user's synthesized self, visually echoing the interplay of various archetypes active in the user's psyche.
5.  **Visual Cohesion & Aesthetics:** The evolution of the mandala must maintain visual harmony and aesthetic appeal. New elements should integrate seamlessly and enhance the overall design, not clutter it.
6.  **Historical View (Optional):** Consider if users can view previous states of their mandala, like a visual history of their progression.
7.  **Performance:** Dynamic updates to the mandala visualization should be performant and not cause lag in the UI.

**Dependencies:**

*   Defined Mahamaya Ground visualization and Identity Dynamics structure (Epic 1).
*   Functional Oracle (Epic 2) and Journal (Epic 3) sections capable of flagging significant events/insights.
*   Nara agent's capability to synthesize information and identify patterns (Epic 4) that could inform these visual changes.
*   Frontend technology capable of complex, dynamic, and layered visualizations.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   E1_F1: Mahamaya Ground: Core Symbolic Framework
*   E5_F1: Phase-Locked Progression & Triadic Flow Dynamics (as the flow feeds this evolution)

**Notes:**

*   The "patina" and "easter eggs" from E5_F2_S1 can be considered as micro-evolutions contributing to this larger Mandala progression, perhaps symbolizing minor integrations or the subtle influence of unconscious processes.
*   The symbolism used for new elements should draw from the established symbolic language of Epi-Logos (e.g., Tarot, alchemy, astrology, quaternary logic).
*   This story is about creating a *living* visual summary of the user's individuation journey, making the UI itself a part of the reflective experience, mirroring the dynamic and evolving nature of the psyche as understood in Jungian psychology.
