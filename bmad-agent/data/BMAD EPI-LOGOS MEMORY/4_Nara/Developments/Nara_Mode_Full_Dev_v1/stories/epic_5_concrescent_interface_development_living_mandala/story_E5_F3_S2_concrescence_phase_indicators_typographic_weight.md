# User Story: E5_F3_S2 - Develop Concrescence Phase Indicators: Typographic Weight as Expressions of Subjective Intensity

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F3 - Concrescence Phase Indicators
**Story ID:** E5_F3_S2

**As a** User (Pramata, an experiencing subject engaging in a process of active imagination and self-discovery),
**I want** the typographic weight used for certain UI text elements (e.g., headings, prompts that are data for prehension) to subtly change (e.g., lighter fonts during reflective, receptive phases of Vimarsha or initial prehensions; bolder fonts during decisive, integrative phases of strong subjective aim or Iccha Shakti),
**So that** I have another ambient, intuitive cue (a felt prehension) about my current phase within a 12-fold concrescence cycle—the creative advance of my experience—reinforcing the UI's responsiveness as a living mirror to my psychic Spanda.

**Description:**

This story focuses on implementing subtle changes in typographic weight as a Concrescence Phase Indicator. Similar to color temperature shifts, these typographic adjustments will provide an ambient signal (a subtle shift in the field of potential prehensions) of the user's current phase in their ongoing concrescence, contributing to the sense of a living interface (Lila) that adapts to their journey of becoming.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Phase-to-Typography Mapping (Typographic Weight as Psychic Emphasis):
    *   A clear mapping is defined between the 12 phases of a concrescence cycle (each an actual occasion with a specific subjective form) and corresponding subtle shifts in typographic weight for designated UI text elements.
    *   Example: Lighter font weights for headings or key prompts during early, contemplative, or dissolution phases (reflecting a more diffuse awareness or the initial, gentle gathering of prehensions).
    *   Example: Gradually increasing to normal or slightly bolder font weights for headings or key prompts during action-oriented, synthesis, or integration phases (reflecting focused Iccha Shakti, strong subjective intensity, or the satisfaction of achieving a novel unity).
2.  **System Awareness of Phase:** The Nara system is aware of the user's current (or assumed) concrescence phase.
3.  **Selective Application:** Typographic weight changes are applied selectively to specific, appropriate UI text elements (e.g., main section headings, key call-to-action prompts) where such a change can convey meaning without impairing readability or core functionality.
4.  **Subtlety and Readability:** The changes in font weight must be subtle enough not to be jarring but noticeable enough to convey a shift. Readability must be maintained at all times; excessively light or bold fonts that hinder comprehension should be avoided.
5.  **Smooth Transitions:** Transitions in typographic weight as the user moves from one phase to another are smooth and gradual if possible, or applied upon clear phase transitions.
6.  **Aesthetic Consistency:** The typographic changes must align with the overall aesthetic of the Nara interface and the chosen font families.
7.  **User Controllability (Optional):** Users might have an option to adjust the intensity of these typographic shifts or disable them, particularly if they have specific accessibility needs related to font weight.
8.  **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure that font weight variations do not negatively impact users with visual impairments. Sufficient contrast and legibility must be preserved.

**Dependencies:**

*   A defined model of the 12-fold concrescence cycle and its phases.
*   A mechanism for Nara to track or infer the user's current concrescence phase.
*   A frontend framework and font selection that supports variable font weights or a sufficient range of predefined weights.
*   Completion of or coordination with E5_F3_S1 (Color Temperature Shifts) to ensure harmonious interplay of indicators.

*   E5_F4: Intuitive Interaction & Navigation (ensuring text remains clear)

**Notes:**

*   This indicator, like others in this feature, aims for ambient awareness (a subtle prehension of the UI's resonance) rather than explicit notification, allowing the user to feel the pulse of their own becoming (Spanda) reflected in the interface.
*   The selection of text elements for this effect is crucial – it should be meaningful and not applied arbitrarily.
*   Careful testing across different screen sizes and resolutions is needed to ensure consistency and readability.
