# User Story: E5_F1_S2 - Implement Dynamic Linkages for Prehensive Unity Between Identity, Oracle, and Journal

**Epic:** E5 - Concrescent Interface Development: The Living Mandala
**Feature:** E5_F1 - Phase-Locked Progression & Triadic Flow Dynamics
**Story ID:** E5_F1_S2

**As a** User (an experiencing subject whose journey is a process of concrescence),
**I want** actions and insights (actual occasions of experience) in one Nara section (Identity, Oracle, Journal) to be intelligently prehended by and influence or unlock relevant features, prompts, or content (potential data for further prehension) in the other sections,
**So that** my experience forms a deeply interconnected nexus of occasions, responsive to my evolving understanding and facilitating a creative advance in my journey toward satisfaction.

**Description:**

This story builds upon the foundational UI flow (E5_F1_S1) by implementing specific dynamic linkages between the Identity Dynamics, Oracle, and Journal sections. These linkages ensure that the user's interactions (individual actual occasions) are not siloed but rather contribute to a wider society of occasions, creating a responsive and evolving dialogue where each part prehends and is prehended by the others, fostering a richer concrescence of meaning within the Nara system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Identity to Oracle Linkage (Prehending Subjective Aim for Divination):
    *   When a user makes significant updates to their Identity Dynamics (actual occasions defining their subjective aim, e.g., a new core intention or challenge area), the system prehends this data and can suggest or automatically unlock specialized Oracle spreads or reading modes (new avenues for prehending relevant eternal objects) tailored to explore these new aspects.
    *   Example: Setting an intention related to "creative expression" (a specific subjective aim) might unlock a "Muse's Whisper" spread in the Oracle, offering data relevant to that aim.
2.  **Oracle to Journal Linkage (Integrating Prehended Data into Narrative Concrescence):
    *   Upon completion of an Oracle session (an actual occasion yielding novel prehensions), the system generates specific, context-aware Journal prompts based on the cards drawn, their positions, and the overall theme of the reading, inviting the user to integrate these prehensions into their ongoing narrative concrescence.
    *   The system can implement time-released Journal prompts for certain cards or concepts (e.g., the full meaning or a follow-up prompt for a "Quintessence" card might be revealed or suggested after a set period like 1-3 days to allow for deeper, temporally extended prehension and integration).
3.  **Journal to Identity Linkage (Refining Subjective Aim from Narrative Satisfaction):
    *   When recurring themes, patterns (potential instantiations of eternal objects), or significant insights (satisfactions from past concrescences) are identified by the user within their Journal entries, the UI suggests revisiting the Identity Dynamics section to update or refine their self-perception, intentions (subjective aim), or visualized Mahamaya Ground, allowing the narrative to inform the ongoing definition of the self as a nexus of occasions.
    *   Example: Consistently journaling about feelings of stagnation (a felt quality of negative prehension) might prompt a review of the "Flow and Blockages" aspect within Identity Dynamics, seeking a new subjective aim towards renewed creative advance.
4.  **Journal to Oracle Linkage (Seeking Further Prehensions from Narrative Gaps):
    *   Significant insights or unresolved questions (gaps in the current concrescence) emerging from Journal entries can trigger suggestions for new Oracle sessions, potentially pre-configuring the Oracle with a relevant query or focus area derived from the journal content, thus directing the user's prehensive activity towards achieving new satisfactions.
5.  **Notification/Indication of Linkages:** The UI clearly, yet subtly, indicates when a new feature, prompt, or suggestion has been unlocked or made available due to actions in another section (e.g., a small badge, a contextual notification).
6.  **Configuration Options (Optional):** Users may have some level of control over the sensitivity or types of dynamic linkages they wish to enable/disable.

**Dependencies:**

*   Completion of E5_F1_S1 (Core Concrescence Rhythm UI/UX Flow).
*   Defined Oracle spreads and reading modes (from Epic 2).
*   Journaling system with prompting capabilities (from Epic 3).
*   Nara agent's ability to process and react to user inputs across sections (Epic 4).
*   `ag-ui` protocol for frontend-backend communication.

**Related Epics/Features:**

*   All features from Epics 1, 2, 3, and 4 that define the content and capabilities of Identity, Oracle, Journal, and Nara agent.

**Notes:**

*   The goal is to create a sense of a living system—a dynamic society of occasions—that responds intelligently to the user's engagement, where each interaction is a prehension contributing to a larger concrescence.
*   The implementation should be robust enough to handle various user paths and interaction styles.
*   Consider the balance between helpful guidance and overwhelming the user with too many automated suggestions.
