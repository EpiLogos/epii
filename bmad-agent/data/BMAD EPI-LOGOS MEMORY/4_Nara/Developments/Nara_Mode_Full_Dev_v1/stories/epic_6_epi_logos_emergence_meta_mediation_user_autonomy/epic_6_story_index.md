# Epic 6: Epi-Logos Emergence, Meta-Mediation & User Autonomy - Story Index

This document provides an index and brief summary of the user stories within Epic 6, focused on the Nara agent's role in fostering user autonomy, symbolic literacy, and the emergence of deeper self-understanding within the Epi-Logos framework. The stories emphasize the integration of Jungian psychology, Kashmir Shaivism, and Whiteheadian process philosophy.

## Feature 1: Deepening Alchemical & Archetypal Engagement

*   **E6_F1_S1: Refined Alchemical Phase Detection Aligned with Epi-Logos's Living Epistemology, Jungian Individuation, Shaivist Spanda, and Whiteheadian Concrescence**
    *   **Summary:** Nara intelligently prehends user's journal entries and interactions to identify alchemical phases (Nigredo, Albedo, etc.), contextualizing them within Jungian individuation, Shaivist Spanda, Whiteheadian concrescence, and the Epi-Logos six-fold architecture. This aims to provide nuanced context to psycho-spiritual development as a personal concrescence reflecting the interplay of consciousness and the unconscious.

*   **E6_F1_S2: Enable Archetypal Composting and Personalized Ritual Creation as Epi-Logos Praxis: Integrating Jungian, Shaivist, and Whiteheadian Insights**
    *   **Summary:** Nara helps identify recurring or challenging archetypal patterns from various user inputs and suggests personalized, symbolic "composting" rituals or reflective practices. This praxis, informed by Jungian integration, Whiteheadian concrescence, and Shaivist recognition, aims to transform psychic energies into catalysts for individuation and creative advance.

*   **E6_F1_S3: Implement Cross-Modal Symbolic Linking for Epi-Logos Coherence: Weaving a Web of Prehensions**
    *   **Summary:** Nara identifies and highlights resonant symbolic connections across different modalities (Oracle, Journal, Identity), leveraging the `bimba_map` to show underlying themes and creative potentials pertinent to the user's current state and their journey through the Epi-Logos architecture. This fosters an integrated experience of the cosmic mind by weaving a web of prehensions.

## Feature 2: Cultivating Self-Interpretation & Unified Knowledge Access

*   **E6_F2_S1: Provide Guided Self-Interpretation Tools Rooted in Epi-Logos Epistemology: Cultivating Prehensive Dialogue and Concrescent Insight**
    *   **Summary:** Nara facilitates self-exploration of symbols and patterns by offering guiding questions and frameworks based on the `bimba_map`'s integrated knowledge. This encourages dia-logical engagement with personal experience, recognizing Spanda within symbols and the potential for novel concrescence, fostering autonomy in the user's Epi-Logos journey.

*   **E6_F2_S2: Provide Pragmatic Access to Unified Knowledge for Epi-Logos Application: Illuminating the Path of Concrescence**
    *   **Summary:** Educational resources and the symbolic lexicon within Nara are dynamically linked to user experiences and contextualized by Epi-Logos philosophy. This makes the `bimba_map`'s knowledge practically accessible, allowing users to see how diverse prehensions contribute to novel concrescence and navigate individuation with clarity.

*   **E6_F2_S3: Provide Feedback Loops on Interpretation Skills for Enhancing Epi-Logos Perception: Cultivating Prehensive Dialogue and Concrescent Awareness**
    *   **Summary:** Nara offers feedback by highlighting how different symbolic inputs might relate through `bimba_map` connections, explained via integrated Epi-Logos insights. This helps users refine their perception of interconnections and their relevance to the Epi-Logos philosophical map, enhancing symbolic literacy.

## Feature 3: Transformational Impact Metrics (Optional & Ethically Framed)

*   **E6_F3_S1: Develop a Symbolic Literacy Index: Gauging Prehensive Fluency and Concrescent Capacity as a Transformational Impact Metric**
    *   **Summary:** An optional indicator of the user's evolving ability to self-interpret symbolic experiences (Prehensive Fluency). It aims to provide a sense of progress in understanding symbolic language as a dynamic process of meaning-making, fostering deeper participation in Epi-Logos and enhancing capacity for novel concrescence.

*   **E6_F3_S2: Develop 'Concrescence Velocity': Tracking the Rhythms of Prehension, Spanda, and Creative Advance as a Transformational Impact Metric**
    *   **Summary:** An optional way to understand the rhythm and depth of engagement with Nara's reflective tools—the interplay between prehensions, their integration, and manifestation as creative advance.
