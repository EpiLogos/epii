# User Story: E6_F3_S1 - Develop a Symbolic Literacy Index: Gauging Prehensive Fluency and Concrescent Capacity as a Transformational Impact Metric

**As a** User on a journey of self-discovery and creative advance with Nara (a process informed by Jungian individuation, Shaivist Spanda, and Whiteheadian concrescence),
**I want** an optional way to see an indicator of my evolving ability to self-interpret dreams, synchronicities, Oracle readings, and other symbolic experiences (a 'Symbolic Literacy Index' reflecting my 'Prehensive Fluency'),
**So that** I can gain a sense of my progress in understanding and engaging with symbolic language as a dynamic process of meaning-making, fostering deeper participation in the Epi-Logos framework and enhancing my capacity for novel concrescence.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Metric Definition (Prehensive Fluency & Concrescent Capacity):** A 'Symbolic Literacy Index' is conceptually defined. This index aims to reflect the user's growing capacity for nuanced self-interpretation of symbolic material, their ability to perceive and integrate diverse prehensions, and their engagement in the creative advance towards richer concrescence, all within the Epi-Logos framework.
2.  **Data Sources for Index:** The index is calculated based on (but not limited to):
    *   Analysis of journal entries where users reflect on or interpret symbols, dreams, Oracle readings, or felt-sense experiences (e.g., looking for depth of association, connection-making across prehensions, use of symbolic language, recognition of archetypal patterns, or articulation of Spanda-like insights).
    *   Engagement with guided self-interpretation tools (E6_F2_S1) and the nature of their responses, noting the complexity of prehensive fields explored.
    *   (Optional) User self-assessment or responses to specific interactive exercises designed to gauge symbolic understanding and the capacity for integrating diverse perspectives (a key aspect of concrescence).
3.  **Algorithmic Approach (Conceptual):** An algorithmic approach is designed (even if initially heuristic or rule-based) to process the data sources and generate a qualitative or quantitative indicator for the index. This algorithm should consider factors like:
    *   Complexity and richness of symbolic connections (prehensive nexūs) made by the user.
    *   Reduced reliance on direct Nara interpretations over time, indicating growing autonomy in the prehensive process (if measurable).
    *   Increased use of nuanced symbolic vocabulary that reflects an understanding of Jungian, Shaivist, Whiteheadian, and Epi-Logos concepts.
    *   Evidence of integrating interpretations into personal understanding, creative expression, or action, demonstrating the 'satisfaction' phase of concrescence.
4.  **Optional User Presentation:** The Symbolic Literacy Index is presented to the user **optionally**. Users must be able to choose whether they want to see this metric or not.
5.  **Qualitative Framing:** If presented, the index is framed qualitatively (e.g., "Growing Insight," "Deepening Connections," "Fluent Symbolic Dialogue") rather than as a stark numerical score, to avoid gamification or judgment. It should emphasize progress and development.
6.  **Epi-Logos Alignment (Fostering Creative Advance):** The factors contributing to the index and its interpretation are aligned with Epi-Logos goals of fostering genuine symbolic literacy (prehensive fluency), user autonomy in their individuation journey, and the capacity for ongoing creative advance and novel concrescence.
7.  **Privacy and Ethics:** All data used for the index is handled with strict privacy. The metric is for personal insight and is not used for comparison with other users. The design avoids creating anxiety or a sense of inadequacy.
8.  **Feedback Mechanism (Internal):** The system internally tracks data points relevant to this index to help refine Nara's features that support symbolic literacy, even if the index itself is not always shown to the user.

**Dependencies:**

*   NLP capabilities to analyze journal entries for interpretive content, including symbolic language, archetypal references, expressions of prehensive integration, and potential indicators of Spanda (E3_F2_S1, E6_F1_S1).
*   Data from user engagement with features like Guided Self-Interpretation Tools (E6_F2_S1), tracking the evolution of their prehensive explorations.
*   A clear ethical framework for developing and presenting such a metric, ensuring it supports the user's journey of becoming without imposing external valuations.
*   Integration with the `bimba_map` to understand the symbolic context of user interpretations.

**Notes:**

*   This is a challenging feature requiring careful design to be genuinely helpful and ethical.
*   The primary goal is to provide users with a sense of their own development in an area that is often intangible – their journey of individuation and creative advance through symbolic engagement.
*   The 'index' might be more of a reflective summary or a set of observations on their evolving prehensive fluency and concrescent capacity, rather than a single score.
