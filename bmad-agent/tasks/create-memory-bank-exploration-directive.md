# Create Memory-bank Exploration Directive Task

## Purpose

- To collaboratively craft a comprehensive directive for internal exploration of the `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/` by the **Epi-Logos Conceptual Analyst**.
- To ensure the exploration is targeted, thorough, and yields actionable insights for a specific `{DevelopmentName}` within its `{PhilosophicalLayer}` and `{Subsystem}`.
- The output is a structured "Memory-bank Exploration Directive" stored as `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/0_conceptual_alignment/memory_bank_exploration_directive.md`.

This task is executed by the **Epi-Logos Conceptual Analyst**.

## Instructions

1.  **Understand Exploration Context & Objectives (for {DevelopmentName}):**
    - Review outputs from the "Conceptual Alignment & Ideation Phase" for `{DevelopmentName}` (if any, these would be in `.../0_conceptual_alignment/conceptual_alignment_insights.md`).
    - Engage with the user to clarify:
      - The primary goals for exploring the memory-bank regarding `{DevelopmentName}`. What specific questions does `{DevelopmentName}` aim to answer or what philosophical alignments does it seek to confirm/discover?
      - The specific decisions the exploration findings will inform for `{DevelopmentName}`.
      - Any existing knowledge, assumptions, or hypotheses related to `{DevelopmentName}` that need to be validated or enriched by exploring the memory-bank.
      - The desired depth and breadth of exploration within `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/`, potentially focusing on specific paths within `Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/`, `Epi-Logos System (Technology)/`, or the relevant `{Subsystem}` directory.

2.  **Collaboratively Develop the Exploration Directive Structure (for {DevelopmentName}):**
    - **Define Overall Objective(s) for Memory Exploration:** Work with the user to draft a clear, concise statement of what the memory-bank exploration aims to achieve for `{DevelopmentName}`.
    - **Identify Key Exploration Areas/Themes within `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/`:** Break down the overall objective into logical sub-topics or themes for investigation. Examples for `{DevelopmentName}`:
        - Relevant philosophical underpinnings from `Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Core_Principles.md` or other philosophical texts.
        - Existing system capabilities, components, or Bimba coordinates within the target `{Subsystem}` (`BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/`) that relate to `{DevelopmentName}`.
        - Technological patterns or principles from `Epi-Logos System (Technology)/` that might inform `{DevelopmentName}`.
        - Historical context or previous development efforts related to the `{DevelopmentName}`'s domain.
    - **Formulate Specific Research Questions for each Key Area/Theme:** Collaboratively generate a list of specific, actionable questions the memory-bank exploration should answer. Ensure questions cover:
      - Factual information needed (e.g., "What are the defined interfaces for `{Subsystem}` component X?").
      - Analytical insights required (e.g., "How does the principle of 'Vibrational Harmony' apply to the proposed interaction model for `{DevelopmentName}`?").
      - Validation of specific hypotheses (e.g., "Does the existing `{Subsystem}` architecture support the proposed data flow for `{DevelopmentName}`?").
    - **Define Target Memory-bank Locations:** Discuss and list specific directories or files within `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/` that are high-priority for review for `{DevelopmentName}`.
    - **Specify Desired Output Format for Exploration Findings:** Determine how the findings from the memory exploration should be structured for maximum usability by the Epi-Logos Conceptual Analyst (e.g., summaries per question, list of relevant Bimba coordinates, extracted key quotes from philosophical texts with commentary).

3.  **Draft the Comprehensive Memory-bank Exploration Directive:**
    - Synthesize all the defined elements (objectives, key areas, specific questions, target memory locations, output format preferences) into a single, well-structured markdown document.
    - The directive should be detailed enough to guide the Epi-Logos Conceptual Analyst effectively during their exploration of the `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/`.
    - Include any necessary context from previous discussions (e.g., key insights from ideation for `{DevelopmentName}`) within the directive.

4.  **Review and Refine the Exploration Directive:**
    - Present the complete draft directive to the user for review and approval.
    - Explain the structure and rationale behind different parts of the directive.
    - Incorporate user feedback to refine the directive, ensuring it is clear, comprehensive, and accurately reflects the exploration needs for `{DevelopmentName}`.

5.  **Finalize and Deliver the Memory-bank Exploration Directive:**
    - Save the finalized directive as `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/0_conceptual_alignment/memory_bank_exploration_directive.md`.
    - <important_note>Advise the user that this directive is now ready to be used for a focused exploration of the `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/`. Discuss next steps, such as the Analyst performing the exploration, and then proceeding to the "Conceptual Alignment Briefing Phase" using the insights gained.</important_note>
