# Create UI/UX Specification Task (Shakti Aspect for {Development Name})

## Purpose

To collaboratively work with the user to define and document the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) specifications for a specific **{Development Name}** within its **{PhilosophicalLayer} / {Subsystem}**. This involves understanding user needs (as seekers/participants in Epi-Logos), defining information architecture, outlining user flows, and ensuring a solid foundation for visual design and frontend development that resonates with Epi-Logos principles. The output will populate a new document, typically `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/design/ui-ux-spec.md`, following the (Epi-Logos aligned) `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` template.

This task is typically executed by the **Epi-Logos Design Architect**.

## Inputs (for {Development Name})

- **Epi-Logos Feature Definition Document (EFDD):** From `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/1_feature_definition/efdd.md`.
- **Conceptual Alignment Brief for {Development Name}:** From `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/0_conceptual_alignment/conceptual_alignment_brief.md`.
- **Frontend Architecture for {Development Name} (if available, may be developed in parallel or iteratively):** From `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/architecture/front-end-architecture.md`.
- User feedback or research relevant to **{Development Name}**.
- Relevant Epi-Logos Memory Context:
    - `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Design_Philosophy.md`
    - `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/User_Archetypes.md`
    - `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Accessibility_Guidelines.md`
    - `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos System (Interface)/Design_System.md` (if it exists)

## Key Activities & Instructions (for {Development Name})

### 1. Understand Core Requirements (for {DevelopmentName})

- Review EFDD and Conceptual Alignment Brief for **{DevelopmentName}** to grasp its goals, target audience (seekers/participants), key features, and any existing constraints.
- Ask clarifying questions about user needs, pain points, and desired outcomes for **{DevelopmentName}** from an Epi-Logos perspective.

### 2. Define Overall UX Goals & Principles (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

  - Target User Personas (as participants in Epi-Logos, referencing global archetypes).
  - Key Usability Goals (e.g., intuitive navigation for seekers, clarity in presenting memory-bank insights).
  - Core Design Principles for **{DevelopmentName}**, aligned with `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Design_Philosophy.md`.

### 3. Develop Information Architecture (IA) (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Work with the user to create a Site Map or Screen Inventory specific to **{DevelopmentName}**.
- Define the primary and secondary Navigation Structure for **{DevelopmentName}**, considering its place within the `{Subsystem}`.
- Use Mermaid diagrams or lists as appropriate.

### 4. Outline Key User Flows (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Identify critical user tasks for **{DevelopmentName}** from the EFDD.
- For each flow within **{DevelopmentName}**:
  - Define the user's (seeker/participant) goal.
  - Collaboratively map out the steps, emphasizing reflective engagement or harmonious interaction.
  - Consider edge cases and error states.

### 5. Discuss Wireframes & Mockups Strategy (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Clarify where detailed visual designs for **{DevelopmentName}** will be created (e.g., Figma) and ensure the spec links to these.
- If low-fidelity wireframes are needed first for **{DevelopmentName}**, offer to conceptualize layouts.

### 6. Define Component Library / Design System Approach (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Discuss if the global `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos System (Interface)/Design_System.md` will be used, or if **{DevelopmentName}** requires specific new components.
- New components for **{DevelopmentName}** should be documented in `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/design/components/`.

### 7. Establish Branding & Style Guide Basics (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Link to global `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Brand_Guidelines.md`.
- Collaboratively define any specific color palette, typography, or iconography nuances for **{DevelopmentName}**.

### 8. Specify Accessibility (AX) Requirements (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Determine target compliance level (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA, per `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/Epi-Logos Project (Philosophy)/Accessibility_Guidelines.md`).
- List specific AX requirements for **{DevelopmentName}**.

### 9. Define Responsiveness Strategy (for `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` of {DevelopmentName})

- Discuss and document key Breakpoints for **{DevelopmentName}**.
- Describe the general Adaptation Strategy for **{DevelopmentName}**.

### 10. Output Generation & Iterative Refinement (Guided by `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` for {DevelopmentName})

- **a. Draft Section:** Incrementally populate one logical section of the UI/UX Spec for **{DevelopmentName}**.
- **b. Present & Incorporate Initial Feedback:** Present the drafted section for **{DevelopmentName}** to the user.
- **c. [Offer Advanced Self-Refinement & Elicitation Options](#offer-advanced-self-refinement--elicitation-options)** (adapted for UI/UX spec of **{DevelopmentName}**).
- Ensure the final document is saved to `BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY/{PhilosophicalLayer}/{Subsystem}/Developments/{DevelopmentName}/design/ui-ux-spec.md`.

## Offer Advanced Self-Refinement & Elicitation Options
