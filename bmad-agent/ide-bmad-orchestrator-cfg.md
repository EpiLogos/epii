# Configuration for IDE Agents (Epi-Logos Aligned)

## Data Resolution

agent-root: (project-root)/bmad-agent
# NEW: Base path for the Epi-Logos Memory
epi-logos-memory-root: (agent-root)/data/BMAD EPI-LOGOS MEMORY

# OLD paths - reviewed for their role (generic/fallback or deprecated)
# Checklists, data, templates might be primarily within epi-logos-memory-root for specific developments,
# but these paths can serve as locations for global/generic ones.
checklists: (agent-root)/checklists
data: (agent-root)/data # General data, not development-specific memory
templates: (agent-root)/templates # Global templates

# Persona and Task definitions remain global
personas: (agent-root)/personas
tasks: (agent-root)/tasks

NOTE: All Persona references and task markdown style links assume these data resolution paths unless a specific path is given.
Example: If above cfg has `agent-root: root/foo/` and `tasks: (agent-root)/tasks`, then below [Create EFDD](create-feature-definition-document.md) would resolve to `root/foo/tasks/create-feature-definition-document.md`
